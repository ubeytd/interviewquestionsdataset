They are a fundamental concept in dynamic programming, used to\ndefine state transitions in the context of a mathematical model and its\ncomputational representation.\n\n\nMODELING STATE TRANSITIONS\n\n 1. State Definition: Identify the core components that define the state of the\n    problem. This step requires a deep understanding of the problem and the\n    information necessary to model the state accurately. State may be defined\n    flexibly, depending on the problem's complexity and nuances.\n\n 2. State Transitions: Define how the state evolves over time or through an\n    action sequence. Transition functions or relations encapsulate the possible\n    state changes, predicated on specific decisions or actions.\n\n 3. Initial State: Establish the starting point of the problem. This step is\n    crucial for state-based algorithms, ensuring that the initial configuration\n    aligns with practical requirements.\n\n 4. Terminal State Recognition: Determine the criteria for identifying when the\n    state reaches a conclusion or a halting condition. For dynamic programming\n    scenarios, reaching an optimal or final state can trigger termimnation or\n    backtracking.\n\n\nSTATE TRANSITION'S COMPUTATIONAL ROLE\n\n * Memory Mechanism: It allows dynamic programming to store and reuse state\n   information, avoiding redundant calculations. This capacity for efficient\n   information retention differentiates it from more regular iterative\n   algorithms.\n * Information Representation: State spaces and their transitions capture\n   essential information about various problem configurations and their mutual\n   relationships.\n\nDynamic programming accomplishes a balance between thoroughness and\ncomputational efficiency by leveraging the inherent structure of problems.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: KNAPSACK PROBLEM & STATE TRANSITIONS\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ndef knapsack01(values, weights, capacity):\n    n = len(values)\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):\n            if weights[i - 1] <= w:\n                dp[i][w] = max(values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w])\n            else:\n                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]\n\n    return dp[n][capacity], dp\n\nvalues = [60, 100, 120]\nweights = [10, 20, 30]\ncapacity = 50\nmax_value, state_table = knapsack01(values, weights, capacity)\nprint(f\"Maximum value achievable: {max_value}\")\n","index":13,"topic":" Dynamic Programming ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nFIND THE LONGEST PALINDROMIC SUBSTRING IN A GIVEN STRING.","answer":"PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nFind the longest palindromic substring within a string s.\n\n * Input: \"babad\"\n * Output: \"bab\" or \"aba\" — The two substrings \"bab\" and \"aba\" are both valid\n   solutions.\n\n\nSOLUTION\n\nThe problem can be solved using either an Expand Around Center algorithm or\nDynamic Programming.

Build the Game Tree: For each possible move, its potential outcomes are\n    considered. This is repeated for subsequent moves, creating a tree\n    structure.\n\n 2.
