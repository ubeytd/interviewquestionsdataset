These documents are often serialized in familiar formats\nsuch as JSON or XML. Key benefits of this approach include enhanced data\nhandling for objects and lower I/O requirements.\n\n\nKEY CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n * Self-Contained: Any necessary references or relationships are embedded within\n   the document, avoiding the need for complex, multi-table queries.\n * Schema Flexibility: Mappings from application objects to database documents\n   are straightforward, and Cosmos DB allows for adaptable data models by\n   supporting multi-dimensional schemas through the use of varied formats and\n   content in documents.\n * Atomicity at Document Level: The database management system assures that\n   operations on a single document are all-or-nothing.\n * Consistency Models: Cosmos DB offers various global distributed architectures\n   for data consistency, enabling customizations based on specific application\n   necessities.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DOCUMENT IN JSON FORMAT\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"1\",\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"addresses\": [\n    {\n      \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\n      \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n      \"state\": \"CA\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"street\": \"456 Elm St\",\n      \"city\": \"Othertown\",\n      \"state\": \"NY\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"contact\": {\n    \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n    \"phone\": \"123-456-7890\"\n  }\n}\n","index":2,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nHOW DOES COSMOS DB ENSURE DATA DURABILITY?","answer":"Cosmos DB ensures data durability using a few key mechanisms: replication,\ntransactions, and backups.\n\n\nWRITE AHEAD LOGGING (WAL)\n\n * Before changes are written to disk, all updates are first recorded in a log.\n   This is known as Write Ahead Logging (WAL).\n * The log is continually synced to disk to guarantee that changes are persisted\n   even if the system crashes.\n\n\nLOG STRUCTURED STORAGE AND COMPACTION LOGS\n\n * In Cosmos DB, data is stored in a log-structured format. A Compaction Log is\n   used to manage the merging and cleanup of data segments. This process ensures\n   that data remains up-to-date, even as it's compacted and reorganized over\n   time.\n\n\nMULTI-VERSION CONCURRENCY CONTROL (MVCC)\n\n * Under MVCC, whenever data is updated, the old version isn't immediately\n   discarded. Instead, it's supplanted by a new version. This mechanism supports\n   snapshot isolation for transactions.\n * When reading data, a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data, even\n   if other transactions are modifying it concurrently.\n\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\n * Cosmos DB offers point-in-time backups to support data loss recovery. This\n   feature automatically captures backups of your data at regular intervals.\n   Should data need to be restored or recovered, these backups are available for\n   that purpose.\n * You have control over the retention period of these backups, allowing you to\n   define the duration for which data is kept in the backup store.\n\n\nREPLICATION AND MULTI-REGION DATA CENTERS\n\n * One of the core features of Cosmos DB is its multi-region replication. This\n   not only allows for high availability by replicating data across different\n   locations but also ensures data durability in the face of regional disasters.\n * All regions housing a Cosmos DB account operate in sync, and any changes made\n   to data are replicated across all regions. Should a region become\n   inaccessible, counterparts are instantly available to ensure continued data\n   integrity and accessibility.","index":3,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE REQUEST UNIT (RU) IN COSMOS DB AND HOW IS IT USED?","answer":"In Cosmos DB, Request Units (RUs) are a measure of the resources needed to\nperform read and write operations.\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING REQUEST UNITS\n\nRUs serve as a unit of measure for database operations. Performing an \"Item\nRead\" or \"Point Query\" requires 1 RU, while heavy operations like \"Query Based\non Several Index Ranges\" can demand up to 10 RUs or more.\n\n\nRUS ALLOCATION MODES\n\n 1. Fixed RUs Mode: Offers predictable pricing by allotting a fixed quantity of\n    RUs to each operation.\n 2. Provisioned RUs Mode: The classic mode where RUs are provisioned in advance\n    and billed hourly.\n\n\nWHAT IS UNDER THE HOOD?\n\nCosmos DB uses a sophisticated infrastructure to manage resources, which can be\nfurther tuned using RUs:\n\n * Storage: Request Units are associated with the storage and retrieval of data.\n * Indexing: They help maintain indexes for efficient querying.\n * Compute: The operations to process the queries need RUs.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: RUS IN ACTION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nvar query = client.CreateDocumentQuery<User>(collectionUri, new SqlQuerySpec(\"SELECT * FROM c\"), queryOptions).AsDocumentQuery();\nvar response = await query.ExecuteNextAsync();\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Request Charge: {response.RequestCharge} RUs\");\n\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nconst querySpec = {\n    query: \"SELECT * FROM c\"\n};\nconst { result: users, rucharge: charge } = await container.items.query(querySpec).fetchAll();\nconsole.log(`Request Charge: ${charge}`);\n\n\nMake sure to test the quota by using the settings in the portal.

Let's discuss each of the ACID properties in the\ncontext of Azure Cosmos DB and refine this topic.\n\n\nACID PROPERTIES IN AZURE COSMOS DB\n\n 1. Atomicity: All or Nothing\n    \n    Atomic transactions in Cosmos DB are like a light switch: they are\n    instantaneous and can only be fully on or fully off.\n\n 2. Consistency: Valid State\n    \n    Cosmos DB ensures the consistency of data, upholding its defined schema and\n    the all-or-nothing principle. If a transaction fails, the system is restored\n    to its state before the transaction began.\n\n 3. Isolation: Independent Actions\n    \n    During a transaction, Cosmos DB is designed to isolate the involved\n    resources, preventing their concurrent access and guarding the transaction's\n    integrity.\n\n 4. Durability: Permanent Changes\n    \n    When a transaction is committed, Cosmos DB guarantees that the changes will\n    be permanently stored and not lost, even in the face of failures. The system\n    ensures this using a combination of synchronous replication, logging, and\n    storage mechanisms.\n\n\nMULTI-MASTER CONFIGURATIONS\n\nIn multi-master configurations, Cosmos DB handles complex scenarios like\nconflicting changes with mixtures of auto-merge and deterministic merge control.\nThese features make multi-master deployments ideal for geographically\ndistributed applications.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ACID TRANSACTIONS IN COSMOS DB\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nusing Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\n\npublic class CosmosDBService\n{\n    private CosmosClient _cosmosClient;\n\n    public CosmosDBService(string connectionString)\n    {\n        _cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(connectionString);\n    }\n\n    public async Task SaveDocumentAsync<T>(string databaseId, string containerId, T document)\n    {\n        var container = _cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseId, containerId);\n        var transactionalBatch = container.CreateTransactionalBatch(new PartitionKey(\"partitionKey\"));\n\n        transactionalBatch.UpsertItem<T>(document);\n        \n        try\n        {\n          await transactionalBatch.ExecuteAsync();\n        }\n        catch (CosmosException ex)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Exception: \" + ex.ToString());\n            throw;\n        }\n    }\n}\n","index":7,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"9.\n\n\nWHAT IS A PARTITION KEY IN COSMOS DB AND HOW IS IT USED?","answer":"In Azure Cosmos DB, the partition key serves as a fundamental design element\nthat dictates the physical data distribution and performance characteristics of\nyour dataset.\n\nWith a well-chosen partition key, you can ensure balanced data distribution,\nefficient data access, and optimized scalability.\n\n\nDESIGN IMPORTANCE\n\nSelecting an appropriate partition key is one of the most critical design\ndecisions in Cosmos DB. It is crucial for:\n\n * Performance: Ensuring that your data access patterns, such as queries and\n   write operations, perform optimally.\n * Scalability: Allowing your container to expand and contract effectively as\n   data volumes and throughputs fluctuate.\n\n\nPHYSICAL DATA ORGANIZATION\n\nPartition keys are used to divide data into logical partitions. Cosmos DB then\ntakes care of distributing these logical partitions across physical partitions,\na transparent process called physical partitioning.\n\n * Each logical partition maps to one or more physical partitions.\n * Data within a logical partition is co-located within the same physical\n   partition.\n * Queries that target a single partition are served from a single physical\n   partition, optimizing performance.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Throughput: The provisioned throughput of a container is shared among all its\n   logical partitions. If you compact a high volume of data and activity into a\n   single partition, it could lead to hot partitions.\n\n * Latency and Resource Consumption: Queries, updates, or deletes that span\n   logical partitions may require distributed coordination, potentially\n   affecting latency and resource usage.\n\n\nCOMMON PARTITION KEY STRATEGIES\n\nNATURAL AND INTRINSIC KEYS\n\nMany datasets possess built-in candidates for partition keys, such as\ncustomer-id, device-id, or location.\n\nSuch keys are referred to as natural keys that are already inherent to the data.\nThey are often the ideal choice as they align with common access patterns and\nfacilitate efficient data placement.\n\nSYNTHETIC OR AUTO-GENERATED KEYS\n\nIn some scenarios, a natural key could be unavailable or inappropriate. In these\ncases, a synthetic key, generated by the application, might be preferred.\n\nExamples include keys based on time ranges, such as the CreatedAt property of a\ndocument, or keys that use a hash of another property for uniform distribution.\n\n * Time-Based Keys: Implementing time-slicing using a well-known algorithm can\n   be useful for telemetry data to ensure recent data is frequently accessed and\n   modified.\n   \n   For example, a partition key based on the year and month could look like\n   202204.\n\n * Balanced Property-Based Keys: When natural keys exist but may not ensure\n   uniform data distribution, a hashed version of the key can be used for\n   balance. In the case of a product-id, you can take a consistent hash of it\n   for distribution uniformity.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: GENERATING A TIME-BASED KEY\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef generate_time_partition_key():\n    return datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m')\n","index":8,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"10.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF LOGICAL PARTITIONS VS PHYSICAL PARTITIONS IN COSMOS DB.","answer":"Cosmos DB is distinguished by its distinctive partitioning strategy.

Choose a key that aligns with these patterns.\n   \n   For example, in a social media application where users frequently post status\n   updates, a partition key of userID along with timestamp can be beneficial as\n   most queries revolve around the user's activities.\n\nCARDINALITY\n\n * High Cardinality: A high-cardinality partition key, such as a unique\n   identifier or timestamp, can distribute data more evenly, avoiding hot\n   partitions. However, make sure it aligns with your query patterns.\n\n * Low or Moderate Cardinality: These types of partition keys can work well if\n   the data within each partition is relatively small and evenly distributed.\n\nPARTITION AUTOPILOT\n\nCosmos DB provides a feature called Autopilot, which automates the process of\nselecting partition keys. It's particularly useful for workloads that are hard\nto predict.\n\nAVOID THESE TRAPS\n\n * Keys That Lead to Skews: Certain keys, like those representing boolean\n   values, may skew data distribution if most of the data falls under one value.\n\n * Keys That Lead to Hot Partitions: If a specific key is frequently accessed or\n   modified, it can result in a hot partition. This problem can arise with\n   monotonically increasing keys, such as timestamps.\n\n\nDYNAMICALLY CHANGING PARTITION KEYS\n\nChanging an existing partition key in a Cosmos DB container is non-trivial and\noften requires creating a new container and migrating the data.\n\nRemember, a well-chosen partition key is central to both data management and\nperformance tuning, making it crucial for laying a strong foundation for your\nCosmos DB setup.","index":10,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"12.\n\n\nWHAT CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN MODELING DATA FOR A COSMOS\nDB INSTANCE?","answer":"When modeling data for Cosmos DB, several best practices can enhance both\nperformance and efficiency.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Access Patterns: Accurately identify and define your primary document types\n   and how they relate to one another.\n\n * Data Structure: Since Cosmos DB is schema-agnostic, the choice of data types\n   (such as nested arrays, object properties, references) should align with\n   expected data output and input formats.\n\n * Model Granularity: Opt for a fine balance between minimizing document size\n   for focused queries and avoiding excessive JOINS.\n\n * Data Distribution: Utilize partition keys to ensure data is evenly\n   distributed, maximizing performance and cost-effectiveness.\n\n * Index Policies: Fine-tune indexing to reflect query patterns and optimize\n   performance.\n\n * Consistency Levels: Choose the most suitable level to balance consistency\n   needs and performance.\n\n * Data Types and Partition Keys: Carefully choose distribution strategies for\n   data types other than strings and partition keys.\n\n * Latency Considerations: Take into account the specific workload requirements,\n   as Cosmos DB supports a mix of low and high latency operations.\n\n * Throughput Efficiency: Balance request units for cost-efficiency; this is\n   critical to avoiding over-provisioning.\n\n\nPARTITION KEYS\n\nUnderstanding Partition Keys is vital for designing high-performance data models\nin Cosmos DB. Typically, you should choose a partition key:\n\n * With a high cardinality.\n * That distributes data evenly.\n * That's frequently used in queries.\n * That minimizes the need for cross-partition queries.\n\n\nCOSMIC RULES\n\n * Data Duplication for Speed: Duplicating data across documents can eliminate\n   the need to perform JOIN operations, boosting query performance. This\n   technique, often called \"denormalization,\" is common in NoSQL databases.\n\n * Size Matters: Keep individual document sizes below 2MB to maximize\n   efficiency. If you frequently require larger documents, consider offloading\n   them to a linked storage solution like Blob storage.\n\n * Selective Indexing: Cosmos DB allows you to exclude properties from the\n   index. This is useful for data that's rarely or never queried.\n\n * Chip Away: Through throttling and other cost-related mechanisms, Cosmos DB\n   can meter resource usage. Regularly monitor and, when necessary, adjust\n   throughput to ensure efficient data handling.\n\n * TTL Leanings: Leveraging the Time to Live (TTL) feature can automatically\n   remove expired data, a critical consideration for regulatory compliance and\n   data hygiene.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: PARTITION KEY SELECTION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class Customer\n{\n    public string Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public string Email { get; set; }\n    public string CountryCode { get; set; }\n\n    // Derive the partition key from the country code for even data distribution\n    [JsonProperty(PropertyName = \"/CountryCode\")]\n    public string PartitionKey => $\"/{CountryCode}\";\n}\n\n\nIn this example, CountryCode serves as the Partition Key.","index":11,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"13.\n\n\nHOW DOES PARTITIONING IMPACT THE SCALABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF A COSMOS DB\nAPPLICATION?","answer":"In Azure Cosmos DB, partitioning plays a key role in the database's scalability\nand performance.

Each container has one or\n   more logical partitions.\n * Physical Partitions: These logical partitions are then distributed across\n   multiple physical partitions. A physical partition represents the unit of\n   scale and the maximum RU/s that can be allocated to a logical partition.\n * Scalability: During Provisioned Throughput mode, RUs are distributed among\n   all the logical partitions within a specific container, providing fair\n   access. In Serverless mode, throughput is consumed on an as-needed basis,\n   accommodating traffic spikes more flexibly.\n\n\nIMPACT ON QUERY EFFICIENCY\n\n * Single-Partition Queries: Queries that target a specific logical partition\n   are the most efficient. They stay within a single physical partition, which\n   optimizes both latency and throughput. Scalability, in this case, is limited\n   based on the RU/s allocated to the specific physical partition.\n\n * Cross-Partition Queries: These include queries that don't specify the\n   partition key and those involving JOINs.

This automated data management approach\ncan greatly benefit your application in various scenarios.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF TTL\n\n * Regulatory Compliance: TTL is instrumental in ensuring data governance and\n   maintaining compliance with data retention policies, particularly for data\n   subjects' rights under GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\n * Cache Expiry: When serving volatile or transient data serving strategies, TTL\n   helps in maintaining cache hygiene and avoiding stale data.\n\n * Cost Reduction: By clearing out obsolete records, you can curtail storage\n   costs.\n\n * Performance Optimization: Keeping the database lean and focused on current,\n   relevant data can enhance query efficiency and overall performance.\n\n\nTTL USE-CASES\n\n * Session or Temporary Data: Use TTL to manage session-specific data or\n   temporary records, like action logs or shopping cart details.\n\n * Analytical Data: For temporary data created during analysis, such as model\n   training, you can set a TTL to remove it after the analytics cycle is\n   complete.\n\n * Device Data: For internet-of-things (IoT) applications or those involving\n   connected devices, TTL can be used to ensure recent device data is maintained\n   while older, often less relevant data is pruned.\n\n * Monitoring and Alerts: In monitoring and alerting systems, use TTL to manage\n   alert thresholds or historical data that's needed for a specific period.\n\n * Consent Logs: For legislations like GDPR or CCPA, organizations are obligated\n   to maintain a record of user consents for a certain time. You can capture\n   consent logs in Cosmos DB and automatically remove them after the set TTL.\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE TTL IN CODE\n\nIn C#, you can configure Time-to-Live Spans in Cosmos DB documents like this:\n\nusing Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;\nusing System;\n\n// Instantiate CosmocClient and Database\n\nContainer container = database.GetContainer(\"myContainer\");\n\n// For inserting or updating a document with TTL value\nMyClass myObject = new MyClass { Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), Property = \"Some Value\", TTL = 3600 }; // Setting TTL to 1 hour (in seconds)\n\nawait container.UpsertItemAsync(myObject, new PartitionKey(myObject.Id));\n\n\nIn the above code snippet, TTL is an integer property representing the\ntime-to-live value in seconds.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR CONFIGURING TTL\n\n * Document-Granularity Handling for TTL: TTL is defined and managed at the\n   document level. This means all fields and sub-documents inside the containing\n   document will inherit this TTL value.\n\n * TTL-index Awareness: When working with Azure Cosmos DB SDKs, they should be\n   version 1.31 or above for robust TTL-index support. For older versions, a\n   missing TTL index results in the system retaining the documents indefinitely.\n\n\nMIGRATING DATA WITH ACTIVE TTL\n\nWhen updating from a Cosmos DB account without TTL support to one with\nTTL-enabled management, the documents from the former account will not inherit\nTTL values. The following code using the Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK demonstrates\nhow to combat this issue:\n\n// Old container without any TTL set\nContainer oldContainer = oldClient.GetContainer(containerName);\n\n// New container with proper TTL set\nContainer newContainer = newClient.GetContainer(containerName);\n\nstring continuationToken = null;\ndo\n{\n    var iterator = oldContainer.GetItemQueryIterator<MyClass>(\"SELECT * FROM c\", requestOptions: new QueryRequestOptions { MaxItemCount = 10, RequestContinuation = continuationToken });\n    var page = await iterator.ReadNextAsync();\n\n    // Bulk operation for updating documents with TTL\n    foreach (var doc in page)\n    {\n        await newContainer.UpsertItemAsync(doc, new PartitionKey(doc.Id));\n    }\n\n    continuationToken = page.ContinuationToken;\n\n} while (continuationToken != null);\n","index":24,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"26.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS IN COSMOS DB AND HOW CAN YOU\nADDRESS THEM?","answer":"Despite its powerful capabilities, Cosmos DB can face performance challenges.

Each level balances\ndata availability, fault tolerance, and latency in its unique way.\n\n\nCONSISTENCY LEVELS\n\nSTRONG CONSISTENCY (BOUNDED STALENESS)\n\n * Description: Guarantees that all reads reflect the most recent writes and are\n   accomplished within a defined time frame or \"staleness.\" This level is\n   particularly well-suited for regulatory and compliance matters.\n * Use Case: Cases where real-time data is essential and a predictable delay is\n   acceptable.\n\nSTRONG CONSISTENCY (SESSION)\n\n * Description: Guarantees strong consistency within an individual session,\n   associating with a specific request and supported by a set of \"write\" and\n   \"read\" operations in the same session.\n * Use Case: Application settings, user profiles, personalized content, and\n   contextually accurate real-time views.\n\nBOUNDED STALENESS\n\n * Description: Delivers high consistency supported by strong guarantees. The\n   model permits out-of-order writes, but the sequence is eventually rectified\n   within a pre-set time frame.\n * Use Case: Luxury needs where slight deviations in ingress order are\n   permissible but necessitate \"in-order\" procession within a certain period.\n\nCONSISTENT PREFIX\n\n * Description: Provides consistency with a definition: if request A preceded\n   request B, then all read requests will reflect the impact of request A or a\n   later impact, like B or any other request.\n * Use Case: Whenever an application needs consistent reads with an encountered\n   sequence of writes, this consistency level ensures that lower latency doesn't\n   lead to an unintended lag in data visibility.\n\nSESSION CONSISTENCY (STRONG CONSISTENCY WITH EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY)\n\n * Description: Returns acknowledged results with the precision of a specific\n   session (akin to no. 2 above, \"strong consistency in a session\") but can also\n   present updates from all sessions in the background asynchronously.\n * Use Case: For applications demanding straightforward low-latency reads and\n   intense write availability and partition resilience, even though minor gaps\n   in sessionality are acceptable. This mode provides an optimal balance of low\n   latency and predictable consistency. It is the default for most scenarios.\n\nEVENTUAL CONSISTENCY\n\n * Description: Offers the lowest level of consistency, meaning reads may\n   sometimes reflect outdated writes.\n * Use Case: Excellent for globally dispersed databases, especially amidst\n   environments with less access to bandwidth that cannot provide guaranteed\n   consistency.\n\nCONSISTENCY LEVELS VS. THROUGHPUT\n\nEach level demands a different amount of Request Unit consumption, affecting an\napplication's latency and economic profile.

While there may be transient inconsistencies, the\n   database eventually becomes consistent.\n\n * Consistency Levels: Cosmos DB offers a range of consistency levels, each\n   tailored to specific requirements. These include \"Strong\",\n   \"Bounded-Staleness\", \"Session\", \"Consistent Prefix\", and \"Eventual\".\n\n * Latency and Performance Impacts: Opting for stronger consistency will\n   typically impact read latencies and throughput more than choosing weaker\n   levels.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY\n\nBEST USES\n\n * Analytical Workflows: For tasks where minute data discrepancies are\n   allowable, such as periodic analytics, weaker consistency levels are\n   preferable.\n\n * Globally-distributed Systems: In multi-datacenter or global setups, where the\n   overhead of strong consistency across regions is prohibitive, weaker models\n   can streamline operations.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Data Freshness: Systems employing weaker models like eventual consistency\n   might reflect slightly outdated states.\n\n * Cache Considerations: Applications often need to update internal caches when\n   fresher data is demanded, necessitating attentive cache management.\n\n * Conflict Management: Synchronizing potentially conflicting data updates is\n   the responsibility of the application, as opposed to the database with\n   stronger consistency.

It ensures that only authorized users and applications\ncan perform operations on resources in your database.\n\nRBAC defines who has access and what they can do.\n\n\nCORE CONCEPTS\n\n * Role: A collection of permissions, such as \"read\" or \"write\", that are\n   applied to a specific resource in Cosmos DB.\n\n * Role Assignment: The association of a role with a Azure AD user, group, or\n   service principal.\n\n * Security Principal: A user or group managed in Azure AD, or an Azure service\n   such as an App Service or Function App that is used to interact with Cosmos\n   DB.\n\n\nSTEPS TO SETUP RBAC\n\n 1. Create a Role Definition\n\nThis can be done via the Azure Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an API. A role\ndefinition includes:\n\n * Actions: The specific operations (such as \"read\", \"write\", or \"all\") a role\n   enables on Cosmos DB resources.\n * Data Actions: The operations a role enables on data in Cosmos DB, such as\n   \"query\" or \"execute stored procedure\".\n * Not Actions: Operations the role denies. If set, these operations take\n   precedence over \"Actions\".\n * Data Not Actions: Operations the role denies on data. If set, these\n   operations take precedence over \"Data Actions\".\n\n 2. Assign the Role Definition to a Security Principal\n\nIn the Azure Portal, navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account. Choose the\n\"Access control (IAM)\" tab, click \"Add\", and then select the role you defined\nearlier. In this step, you specify the Azure AD user, group, or managed identity\nto which the role definition will apply.\n\n 3.

Keep in mind that\nvertical scaling involves changing RU/s for the entire collection, affecting\nboth read and write operations.\n\n\nVIRTUAL PARTITIONING: HORIZONTAL SCALING\n\nPros: Offers fine-grained control; best for unpredictable workloads.\n\nCons: Might incur extra costs due to maintenance and complexity.\n\nWith this method, you split the data across several logical partitions, referred\nto as virtual partitions. Then, you monitor performance at each level and\ndistribute Request Units (RUs) accordingly.\n\n\nAUTO-PILOT: AUTOMATIC HORIZONTAL SCALING\n\nPros: Ideal for hands-off management, especially with varying workloads.\n\nCons: Might lead to higher costs if not monitored.\n\nAuto-Pilot simplifies virtual partitioning by handling the distribution of RUs\nautomatically.

If you anticipate either a consistent or sporadic load, you can\nmake an informed choice.\n\n\nMANAGED TABLE: FOR BEGINNERS\n\nThe Managed Table approach is the easiest to configure. However, it might not\nprovide the same level of optimized performance as manual throughput adjustments\nor virtual partitioning.\n\n\nPROFILER TOOL: FOR ADVANCED TUNING\n\nIf you have specific performance requirements or if you're looking to scale the\ndatabase optimally, you can use the Cosmos DB Profiler Tool. This tool helps you\nmake evidence-driven decisions by logging all the operations and the\ncorresponding request units, enabling you to observe the resource consumption\nfor a particular workload.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Analyze and configure the most suitable scalability model to cater to your\n   application's specific requirements.\n * Keep an eye on Request Unit (RU) consumption, especially when using\n   Auto-Pilot.\n * For vertical scaling, set Provisioned Throughput close to the measured RUs\n   from Azure Portal.\n * When using Auto-Pilot, validate the optimal grades by simulating the traffic\n   accurately to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.","index":40,"topic":" Cosmos DB ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"42.\n\n\nDISCUSS HOW COSMOS DB FITS INTO A MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE.","answer":"Cosmos DB offers several features that align with the needs of microservices:\nscalability, multiple consistency levels, and a flexible data model (NoSQL).\n\n\nHIGH AVAILABILITY AND PARTITIONING\n\nCosmos DB's distributed nature and automatic multi-region replication ensure\nhigh availability.

Document Versioning: A version number or timestamp is associated with each\n    document. When updates occur, these values are incremented or updated.\n\n 2. Read and Prepare Phase: Before updating a document, the system retrieves the\n    latest version. If versions don't match, there's a potential conflict.\n\n 3. Write: If the versions match, the document is updated. If not, the operation\n    is aborted, and the app can decide how to proceed.\n\n 4. User Resolve: If there's a conflict, users can handle it manually, possibly\n    marrying different versions or implementing more sophisticated\n    reconciliation logic.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: INCREMENTING VERSIONS\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Document retrieval\ndocument = client.ReadDocument('documentLink')\n\n# Increment version\ndocument['_etag'] = document['_etag']  # etag property auto-updates with each version\n\n# Update document\nupdated_document = client.ReplaceDocument('documentLink', document)\n\n\nIn this example, we obtain a document, then update and upload it with its\nexisting _etag to ensure we are working with the latest version.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE\n\n * Network Efficiency: Optimistic control often requires less bandwidth compared\n   to locking mechanisms used in traditional RDBMS, which can make it suitable\n   for distributed systems, including mobile and IoT applications.\n\n * Concurrency Is Expected to Be Low: While optimistic control mitigates data\n   conflicts, its reliance on version checks can introduce latency and potential\n   conflicts under high throughput.
