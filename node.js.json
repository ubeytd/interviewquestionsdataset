This setup allows Node.js to stay\nresponsive to incoming requests, benefiting from asynchronous I/O.\n\nThe main event loop regains control once the task on the child thread is\ncompleted, and results are ready.\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Boosted Efficiency: Offloading certain tasks to worker threads prevents I/O\n   or computation-heavy jobs from blocking the event loop.\n * Convenient Multi-Threading: Node.js enables multi-threading without the\n   complexities of managing threads directly.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC MULTI-THREADING TASK\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n// Import the built-in 'worker_threads' module\nconst { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');\n\n// Check if it's the main module\nif (isMainThread) {\n  // Create a new child worker\n  const worker = new Worker(__filename);\n\n  // Listen for messages from the worker\n  worker.on('message', message => console.log('Received:', message));\n\n  // Send a message to the worker\n  worker.postMessage('Hello from the main thread!');\n} else {\n  // Listen for messages from the main thread\n  parentPort.on('message', message => {\n    console.log('Received in the worker:', message);\n    // Send a message back to the main thread\n    parentPort.postMessage('Hello from the worker thread!');\n  });\n}\n","index":1,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE EVENT-DRIVEN PROGRAMMING IN NODE.JS.","answer":"Event-driven programming, a hallmark of Node.js, uses an event, listener, and\nemitter architecture to handle asynchronous tasks.

These callback functions will be asynchronously carried out\n   when a matching event is emitted.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: EVENT EMITTER AND HANDLERS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst { EventEmitter } = require('events');\nconst emitter = new EventEmitter();\n\nemitter.on('event-name', (eventArgs) => {\n    console.log(`Event-name was emitted with arguments: ${eventArgs}`);\n});\n\nemitter.emit('event-name', 'Some Payload');\n\n\nIn this code, when emit is called, the on method's callback is executed\nasynchronously.\n\n\nEVENT LOOP MECHANISM IN NODE.JS\n\n * Call Stack: Maintains the call order of the functions and methods being\n   executed.\n\n * Node APIs and Callbacks Queue: Handle I/O tasks and timers.\n\n * Event Loop: Constantly watches the execution stack and checks whether it's\n   clear to execute pending tasks from the Callback Queue.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS IN NODE.JS\n\n * HTTP Server: Listens for and serves requests.\n\n * File System Operations: Execute I/O tasks.\n\n * Database Operations: Such as data retrieval.","index":2,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE EVENT LOOP IN NODE.JS?","answer":"The event loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js for managing asynchronous\noperations. Its efficiency is a key reason behind Node.js's high performance.\n\n\nHOW DOES THE EVENT LOOP WORK?\n\n 1. Initialization: When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop to watch\n    for I/O operations and other asynchronous tasks.\n\n 2. Queueing: Any task or I/O operation is added to a queue, which can be either\n    the microtask queue or the macrotask/Callback queue.\n\n 3. Polling: The event loop iteratively checks for tasks in the queue while also\n    waiting for I/O and timers.\n\n 4. Execution Phases: When the event loop detects tasks in the queue, it\n    executes them in specific phases, ensuring order efficiency.\n\n\nTASK SCHEDULER ZONES: MICROTASK AND CALLBACK QUEUE\n\n * Microtask Queue: This is a highly prioritized queue, usually acting over\n   tasks in the Callback Queue. Useful for tasks that require immediate\n   attention.\n * Callback Queue (Macrotask Queue): Also known as the 'Task Queue,' it manages\n   events and I/O operations.\n\n\nEVENT LOOP PHASES\n\n * Timers: Manages timer events for scheduled tasks.\n * Pending callbacks: Handles system events such as I/O, which are typically\n   queued by the kernel.\n * Idle / prepare: Ensures internal actions are managed before I/O events\n   handling.\n * Poll: Retrieves New I/O events.\n * Check: Executes 'setImmediate' functions.\n * Close: Handles close events, such as 'socket.close'.\n\n\nTASK SCHEDULING: MICROTASKS AND MACROTASKS\n\n * Microtasks (process.nextTick and Promises): Executed after each task.\n * Macrotasks: Executed after the poll phase when the event loop is not behind\n   any file I/O or scheduled time. This includes timers, setImmediate, and I/O\n   events.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TIMERS AND TASK QUEUES\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n// Code Example\nconsole.log('Start');\n\nsetTimeout(() => {  \n  console.log('Set Timeout - 1');\n  \n  Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n    console.log('Promise - 1');\n  }).then(() => {\n    console.log('Promise - 2');\n  });\n\n}, 0);\n\nsetImmediate(() => {\n  console.log('Set Immediate');\n});\n\nprocess.nextTick(() => {\n  console.log('Next Tick');\n  // It's like an infinite loop point for microtask queue\n  process.nextTick(() => console.log('Next Tick - nested'));\n});\n\nfs.readFile(file, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log('File Read');\n});\n\nconsole.log('End');\n","index":3,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NODE.JS AND TRADITIONAL WEB SERVER TECHNOLOGIES?","answer":"Node.js revolutionized server-side development with its non-blocking,\nevent-driven architecture. Let's look at how it differs from traditional web\nservers and how it leverages a Single Input-Output (I/O) model.\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\nMULTI-THREADING (TRADITIONAL SERVERS) VS. EVENT LOOP (NODE.JS)\n\n * Traditional Servers: Employ multi-threading. Each client request spawns a new\n   thread, requiring resources even when idle.\n * Node.js: Utilizes a single-thread with non-blocking, asynchronous functions\n   for I/O tasks. This makes it exceptionally suitable for scenarios like\n   real-time updates and microservices.\n\nBLOCKING VS. NON-BLOCKING I/O\n\n * Traditional Servers: Primarily rely on blocking I/O, meaning that the server\n   waits for each I/O operation to finish before moving on to the next task.\n * Node.js: Leverages non-blocking I/O, allowing the server to continue handling\n   other tasks while waiting for I/O operations. Callbacks, Promises, and\n   async/await support this approach.\n\nLANGUAGE CONSISTENCY\n\n * Traditional Servers: Often pair with languages like Java, C#, or PHP for\n   server-side logic. Front-end developers might need to be proficient in both\n   the server language and client-side technologies like JavaScript.\n * Node.js: Employs JavaScript both client-side and server-side, fostering\n   full-stack developer coherence and code reusability.\n\nCODE EXECUTION\n\n * Traditional Servers: Generally compile and execute code. Alterations might\n   necessitate recompilation and possible downtime.\n * Node.js: Facilitates a \"write, save, and run\" approach, without the need for\n   recompilation.\n\nPACKAGE MANAGEMENT\n\n * Traditional Servers: Rely on package managers like Maven or NuGet, with each\n   language typically having its own package dependency system.\n * Node.js: Centralizes dependency management via npm, simplifying the sharing\n   and integration of libraries.\n\nDEPLOYMENT\n\n * Traditional Servers: Often necessitate coordination with systems, database\n   administrators, and IT teams for deployment.\n * Node.js: Offers flexible, straightforward deployments. It's especially suited\n   for cloud-native applications.\n\n\nUSE CASES\n\n * Traditional Servers: Ideal for enterprise systems, legacy applications, or\n   when extensive computational tasks are required.\n * Node.js: Well-suited for data-intensive, real-time applications like\n   collaborative tools, gaming, or social media platforms. Its lightweight,\n   scalable nature also complements cloud deployments.","index":4,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nEXPLAIN WHAT \"NON-BLOCKING\" MEANS IN NODE.JS.","answer":"Node.js leverages non-blocking I/O to handle multiple operations without waiting\nfor each to complete separately.\n\nThis particular I/O model, coupled with the event-driven paradigm of Node.js, is\nkey to its high performance and scalability, making it ideal for tasks such as\ndata streaming, background tasks, and concurrent operations.\n\n\nNON-BLOCKING I/O\n\nWith non-blocking I/O, an application doesn't halt or wait for a resource to\nbecome available. Instead, it goes on executing other tasks that don't depend on\nthat resource.\n\nFor instance, if a file operation is in progress, Node.js doesn't pause the\nentire application until the file is read or written. This allows for a more\nresponsive and efficient system, especially when handling multiple, concurrent\nI/O operations.\n\n\nEVENT LOOP\n\nNode.js constantly monitors tasks and I/O operations. When a task or operation\nis ready, it triggers an event. This mechanism is referred to as the event loop.\n\nWhen an event fires, a corresponding event handler or callback function is\nexecuted.\n\n\nCONCURRENCY WITHOUT THREADS\n\nTraditionally, concurrency can be achieved in languages that support\nmultithreading (e.g., Java). However, managing and coordinating multiple threads\ncan be challenging and is a common source of bugs.\n\nNode.js, on the other hand, provides a simplified yet effective concurrency\nmodel using non-blocking I/O and the event loop. It achieves parallelism through\nmechanisms such as callbacks, Promises, and async/await.\n\nBy not using threads, Node.js eliminates many of the complexities associated\nwith traditional multithreaded architectures, making it easier to develop and\nmaintain applications, particularly those requiring high concurrency.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: FILE I/O\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Perform non-blocking file read operation\nfs.readFile('path/to/file', (err, data) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(data);\n});\n\n// Other non-blocking operations continue without waiting for file read\nconsole.log('This message is displayed immediately.');\n\n\nIn this example, the file read operation is non-blocking. Node.js does not halt\nthe thread of execution to wait for the file read to complete. Instead, the\nsupplied callback function is invoked when the read operation finishes.","index":5,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU UPDATE NODE.JS TO THE LATEST VERSION?","answer":"Regular updates ensure that your Node.js setup is secure, efficient, and\nequipped with the latest features.

This file is essential for managing project\nmodules, scripts, and version control and helps ensure the consistency and\nstability of your project.\n\n\nKEY ELEMENTS\n\nThe package.json file consists of several essential sections:\n\n 1. Name and Version: Required elements that identify the project and its\n    version.\n\n 2. Dependencies: Separated into dependencies, devDependencies, and\n    optionalDependencies which list package dependencies needed for development,\n    production, or as optional features, respectively.\n\n 3. Scripts: Encompasses a series of custom commands, managed by npm or yarn,\n    that can be executed to perform various tasks.\n\n 4.

Import the Module: Use require to load the http module.\n\n 2. Define Callback Function: For each request, the server will execute a\n    specific callback function. This function takes two parameters:\n    \n    * request: Represents the HTTP request, from which you can extract any\n      necessary data.\n    * response: Use this parameter to define what the server sends back to the\n      client.\n\n 3. Server Initialization: Use the http.createServer method to set up the server\n    and define the callback function.\n\n 4. Listen on a Port: Use the .listen method to specify the port the server\n    should \"listen\" on, waiting for incoming requests.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SERVER SETUP\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\n// Import the http module\nconst http = require('http');\n\n// Define the callback function\nconst requestListener = (req, res) => {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end('Hello, World!');\n};\n\n// Server initialization\nconst server = http.createServer(requestListener);\n\n// Listen on port 8080\nserver.listen(8080);\n\n\n\nREQUEST HANDLER\n\nThe Request listener is the main entry to the server. This callback function\nhandles the incoming client request and sends a response back to the client.\n\nThe req [https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage]\nobject represents the HTTP request that the server receives. It provides all the\ndetails about the request, such as the request URL, request headers, request\nmethod, and more.\n\nThe res object is the server's response to the client. You can use methods on\nthis object, like res.write() and res.end(), to send data back to the client. In\nmost cases, you'll use res.end() to send a response.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REQUEST LISTENER WITH MORE CAPABILITIES\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst requestListener = (req, res) => {\n  if(req.url === '/profile') {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    res.end('Welcome to your profile!');\n  } else {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    res.end('Hello, World!');\n  }\n};\n\n\nIn this example, we're checking the request URL. If it's /profile, the server\nwill respond with a \"Welcome!\" message; otherwise, it will respond with \"Hello,\nWorld!\".\n\nThis server is basic yet powerful.

Their\n   function names end with File.\n * Synchronous Methods: Best suited for simpler scripts and robustness is\n   needed.\n * File Names: As a convention, file and folder names in the Node.js fs module\n   that correspond to methods end with Sync to indicate synchronous operations\n   (e.g., renameSync).\n\n\nTHE SYNCHRONOUS APPROACH\n\nThough the synchronous file methods can make scripting simpler, their use should\nbe limited in web servers as they can block the event loop, reducing scalability\nand performance.\n\nSynchronous operations in Node's fs module are best avoided in server-side\napplications that must manage many connections.\n\n\nSUPPORTED OPERATIONS\n\nThe fs module covers a wide array of file-handling tasks, including:\n\n * I/O Operations: Read or write files using streams or high-level functions.\n * File Metadata: Obtain attributes such as size or timestamps.\n * Directories: Manage folders and the files within them, including sync and\n   async variants for listing.\n * File Types: Distinguish between files and directories.\n * Links: Create and manage hard or symbolic links.\n * Permissions and Ownership: Integrate with operating systems' security\n   systems.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: FILE READING\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Asynchronous read\nfs.readFile('input.txt', (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(err);\n  }\n  console.log('Asynchronous read: ' + data.toString());\n});\n\n// Synchronous read\nconst data = fs.readFileSync('input.txt');\nconsole.log('Synchronous read: ' + data.toString());\n\n\nIn the above code, both asynchronous and synchronous methods are demonstrated\nfor file reading.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR THE WEB\n\nWhen working with HTTP connections or in web applications, the synchronous\nmethods may block other requests.

To resize a\n   buffer, you'd need to create a new buffer with the necessary size and\n   optionally copy over the original data.\n\n * Shared Memory: Buffers provide a mechanism for sharing memory between Node.js\n   instances or between Node.js and C++ Addons, offering enhanced performance in\n   certain scenarios.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * File and Network Operations: Buffers are leveraged for reading and writing\n   data from files, sockets, and other sources/sinks.\n\n * Data Conversion: For example, converting text to binary data or vice versa\n   using character encodings such as UTF-8.\n\n * Binary Calculations: Buffers make binary manipulations more manageable, such\n   as computing checksums or parsing binary file formats.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BUFFER USE\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nlet bufTemp = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nconsole.log(bufTemp.toString()); // Output: Hey!\n\nlet bufAlloc = Buffer.alloc(5, 'a');\nconsole.log(bufAlloc.toString()); // Output: aaaaa\n\nbufAlloc.write('Hello');\nconsole.log(bufAlloc.toString()); // Output: Hello\n\nlet bufSlice = bufAlloc.slice(0, 3);  // Slice the buffer\nconsole.log(bufSlice.toString());  // Output: Hel\n","index":13,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nWHAT ARE STREAMS IN NODE.JS AND WHAT TYPES ARE AVAILABLE?","answer":"Node.js utilizes streams for efficient handling of input/output data, offering\ntwo main varieties: readable and writable.\n\n\nCATEGORIES OF STREAMS\n\n 1. Standard Streams: Represent standard input, output, and error. These are\n    instances of Readable or Writable streams.\n\n 2. Duplex Streams: Facilitate both reading and writing. They can be connected\n    to processes or handling pipelines.\n\n 3. Transform Streams: A special type that acts as an intermediary, modifying\n    the data as it passes through.\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS\n\n * HTTP Transactions: HTTP clients use readable and writable streams for sending\n   requests and receiving responses. HTTP servers also apply these streams for\n   similar actions in the opposite direction.\n\n * File System: Reading and writing files in Node.js utilizes these streams. For\n   instance, the fs.createReadStream() method generates a readable stream\n   whereas fs.createWriteStream() creates a writable one.\n\n\nWORKFLOWS\n\n 1. Standard I/O Streams: These support interactivity between a program and its\n    running environment. For example, stdout (a writable stream) can be used to\n    display information, and stdin (a readable stream) can capture user input.\n\n 2. File Operations: Streams are beneficial when working with large files. This\n    is because they streamline the process by breaking it down into smaller,\n    manageable chunks, thereby conserving memory.\n\n 3. Server Operations: Streams facilitate data transfer for operations such as\n    network requests, database communications, and more.\n\n 4. Pipelines: Streams can be easily combined using pipe() to create powerful,\n    efficient operations called pipelines. For instance, to compress a file and\n    then write it to disk, you can pipe a readable stream to a transform stream\n    and then to a writable stream.

Custom In-Memory Servers: Launch a server in-memory on a dynamic port and\n    test it using direct HTTP clients or libraries.\n\n 4. Mock Servers: When external systems need to be tested, use tools like Nock\n    or Polly to create mock HTTP servers that emulate the behavior of these\n    external systems.\n\n\nLIST OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES TO TEST AN HTTP SERVER\n\n * Ping Test: Ensure that the server responds to requests. Use a simple GET\n   request and assert a 200 status.\n\n * Static File Serving: Confirm that files are being served correctly. Send a\n   GET request for a known static file and verify the returned data.\n\n * Handling POST Requests: Verify the server processes POST requests as\n   expected.\n\n * JSON Payload Verification: If the server processes JSON data, verify that it\n   can parse and respond to JSON payloads.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION IN NODE.JS\n\nHere you can find a list of related tests and a code example.\n\nRUNNING THE SERVER ON A FREE PORT\n\nEven though the tests don't run during server execution, the server should be\nset to run on a free port. This prevents conflicts if the tests are run\nalongside a functional server. The getFreePort\n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-port] function can be helpful in this\ncontext.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IMPLEMENTATION FOR ADVANCED TESTS OF AN HTTP SERVER IN NODE.JS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst http = require('http');\nconst { getFreePort } = require('get-port');\nconst fetch = require('node-fetch');\n\nlet server;\nlet port;\n\n// Test cases\ndescribe('HTTP Server Tests', () => {\n  beforeAll(async () => {\n    port = await getFreePort();\n    server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n      if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/user') {\n        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n        res.end(JSON.stringify({ name: 'John Doe' }));\n      } else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/user') {\n        req.on('data', chunk => {\n          const data = JSON.parse(chunk.toString());\n          if (data.name) {\n            res.writeHead(201, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n            res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'User created' }));\n          } else {\n            res.statusCode = 400;\n            res.end('Name is required');\n          }\n        });\n      } else if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {\n        res.end('Welcome to our server');\n      } else {\n        res.statusCode = 404;\n        res.end('Resource not found');\n      }\n    });\n    server.listen(port);\n  });\n\n  afterAll(() => {\n    server.close();\n  });\n\n  test('Server should respond with user data', async () => {\n    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:${port}/user`);\n    expect(response.status).toBe(200);\n    expect(response.headers.get('Content-Type')).toBe('application/json');\n    const json = await response.json();\n    expect(json.name).toBe('John Doe');\n  });\n\n  test('Server should create user on POST request', async () => {\n    const userData = { name: 'Jane Doe' };\n    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:${port}/user`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify(userData),\n    });\n    expect(response.status).toBe(201);\n    expect(response.headers.get('Content-Type')).toBe('application/json');\n    const json = await response.json();\n    expect(json.message).toBe('User created');\n  });\n\n  test('Server should handle non-existent routes', async () => {\n    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:${port}/invalid`);\n    expect(response.status).toBe(404);\n  });\n\n  test('Server should handle incorrect POST data', async () => {\n    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:${port}/user`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({}),\n    });\n    expect(response.status).toBe(400);\n    const text = await response.text();\n    expect(text).toBe('Name is required');\n  });\n\n  test('Server should serve static content', async () => {\n    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:${port}/`);\n    const text = await response.text();\n    expect(text).toBe('Welcome to our server');\n  });\n});\n\n\nThis implementation features unit tests to ensure that the server behaves as\nexpected.\n\nThe GET requests check the data in the response body, its content type, and the\noverall status, while the POST requests ensure correct handling and response.\n\nIt's also essential to test how the server handles invalid requests or\nnon-existent routes.

While ORM solutions\nexpedite common CRUD operations, their adaptability to unique requirements\nvaries.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Automated Query Generation: ORM tools autonomously craft database queries,\n   minimizing manual query writing. This feature helps reduce errors associated\n   with hand-coding queries.\n\n * Data Validations: Before writing data to the database, ORM tools often ensure\n   it meets certain criteria, reducing the risk of inconsistent or corrupt data.\n\n * Standardized Interface: ORM provides a uniform method of interacting with\n   databases, regardless of the underlying database management system (DBMS).\n   This fosters portability between database systems, though complete freedom is\n   not always guaranteed.\n\n * Data Relationship Management: ORMs streamline the handling of complex\n   relationships such as one-to-many or many-to-many. Developers can describe\n   these relationships in their application code, and ORMs translate this logic\n   into appropriate database operations.\n\n * Migrations: Some ORMs offer migration capabilities, enabling version control\n   for your database schema. This feature is especially valuable in\n   collaborative environments and production settings.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL DOWNSIDES\n\n * Performance Overhead: The additional layer of abstraction can introduce\n   performance costs. While modern ORM tools like Sequelize and TypeORM aim to\n   mitigate this impact, it's essential to monitor the performance of\n   ORM-powered applications.\n\n * Complexity in Learning Curve: Learning an ORM framework might sometimes be\n   more demanding than mastering direct SQL queries, especially for database\n   optimizations and advanced operations.\n\n * Underlying Query Control: In certain performance-critical scenarios,\n   developers may need finer control over SQL queries, which formulations\n   provided by ORM tools might not entirely fulfill.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SEQUELIZE IN ACTION\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n// Define the 'User' model that Sequelize will map to a database table\nconst User = sequelize.define('user', {\n  // Specify attributes and their data types\n  firstName: {\n    type: DataTypes.STRING,\n    allowNull: false  // Set validation rules\n  },\n  lastName: {\n    type: DataTypes.STRING\n  }\n});\n\n// Basic CRUD operations using Sequelize\nasync function createUser(firstName, lastName) {\n  // Create a new user instance\n  const user = await User.create({ firstName, lastName });\n  return user;  // Returns the created user from the database\n}\n\nasync function findUserById(id) {\n  // Retrieve the user with the given ID\n  const user = await User.findByPk(id);\n  return user;  // Returns the user found, or null if not found\n}\n\nasync function updateUserLastName(id, newLastName) {\n  // Update the last name of the user with the given ID\n  const [updatedRecordsCount, updatedUsers] = await User.update(\n    { lastName: newLastName },\n    { where: { id }, returning: true }\n  );\n  return updatedRecordsCount;  // Returns the number of updated records\n}\n\nasync function deleteUserById(id) {\n  // Delete the user with the given ID\n  const deletedCount = await User.destroy({ where: { id } });\n  return deletedCount;  // Returns the number of deleted records\n}\n\n\nIn this code snippet, Sequelize manages the User model, which corresponds to a\ndatabase table.

Database Adapters: With various libraries like Mongoose for MongoDB or\n    Sequelize for SQL databases, integrating data operations becomes simpler,\n    promoting separation of concerns.\n\n 4. Message Brokers: For asynchronous communication between microservices,\n    Node.js can be combined with message brokers like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka,\n    using libraries such as amqplib to enable fast, decoupled services.\n\n 5. Service Discovery: Tools like Consul, ZooKeeper, or Eureka can be utilized\n    for dynamic service registration and resolution.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: NODE.JS MICROSERVICE\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = 3000;\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\n// In-memory data for the sake of example.\nconst users = [];\n\n// Define a POST endpoint to add a user.\napp.post('/users', (req, res) => {\n  const { id, name } = req.body;\n\n  const newUser = { id, name };\n  users.push(newUser);\n\n  res.status(201).json(newUser);\n});\n\n// Define a GET endpoint to fetch all users.\napp.get('/users', (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).json(users);\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Microservice running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n\n\nIn this example, we leverage Express.js to create a basic RESTful service. The\napp.post and app.get methods define the POST and GET endpoints.

Core modules like cluster and event-driven\nparadigms, such as EventEmitters, enable inter-process communication (IPC).\n\nCORE MODULES FOR IPC\n\n 1. Cluster: Maintains a set of worker processes and efficiently distributes\n    incoming connections. This is often used in web servers.\n\n 2. Child Process: Launches new Node.js processes and communicates with them via\n    IPC channels.\n\nEVENTEMITTER\n\nThis is Node.js's built-in module for event-driven communication. It is reliable\nand fast. Nodes usually use the more explicit methods like emit(), on(), and\nonce(). But in case you need more flexibility, you can also use addListener()\nand removeListener() consistently with the other method names.\n\nPUB/SUB MECHANISM\n\nThis mechanism, while commonly associated with message queues, provides a\none-to-many event distribution channel between microservices or their individual\nprocesses. This pattern allows for event-driven communication at scale.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING CLUSTER\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\n// master.js\nconst cluster = require('cluster');\nconst numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;\n\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n    // Fork workers.\n    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {\n        cluster.fork();\n    }\n\n    cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {\n        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);\n    });\n\n    cluster.on('online', (worker) => {\n        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} is now online`);\n    });\n} else {\n    // Specific worker or task code\n}\n\n\nIn this example, the main process is the master, which forks worker processes.\nCommunication between the master and workers occurs through IPC.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING CHILD_PROCESS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\n// main.js\nconst { fork } = require('child_process');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst worker = fork(path.join(__dirname, 'worker.js'));\n\n// Listen for messages from the worker\nworker.on('message', (message) => {\n    console.log('Message from worker:', message);\n});\n\n// Send a message to the worker\nworker.send({ hello: 'world' });\n\n\nThe worker process looks like this:\n\n// worker.js\nprocess.on('message', (message) => {\n    console.log('Message from main:', message);\n    // Send a message back to the main process\n    process.send({ foo: 'bar' });\n});\n\n\nIn this code, the main process (main.js) uses fork() to create a separate worker\nprocess, which in turn communicates with the main process through message\nevents.\n\nThe worker listens for messages using process.on('message', ...), and it can\nsend messages back to the main process using process.send(...). The main process\nlistens for events using the regular EventEmitter methods.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING EVENTEMITTER\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\n// event-emitter.js\nconst EventEmitter = require('events');\n\nconst myEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n\nmyEmitter.on('event', () => {\n  console.log('an event occurred!');\n});\n\n// With aync boolean\nfunction someAsyncOperation(callback) {\n  setImmediate(() => {\n    callback();\n  });\n}\n\nsomeAsyncOperation(() => {\n    myEmitter.emit('event');\n});\n\n// Without aync boolean\nmyEmitter.emit('event');\n\n\nIn this example, the myEmitter is an instance of EventEmitter which allows the\nregistration of event listeners with on(), and emission of events with emit().\nThis snippet demonstrates both synchronous and asynchronous event emissions.\n\nVISUAL REPRESENTATION\n\nIPC in Node.js [https://i.stack.imgur.com/otbiE.png]","index":49,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"51.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR NODE.JS APPLICATIONS?","answer":"Ensuring the security of your Node.js applications is crucial. This can be\nachieved by adhering to several best practices.\n\n\nKEY SECURITY BEST PRACTICES\n\n 1.  Apply Rate-Limiting: Throttling access to APIs can mitigate DDoS and\n     brute-force attacks. Libraries such as express-rate-limit are helpful.\n\n 2.  Sanitize User Input: Use libraries like express-validator to validate and\n     sanitize user input, significantly reducing the risk of XSS and\n     SQL-injection attacks.\n\n 3.  Use Secure Data Storage: Sensitive data such as credentials should be\n     encrypted using secure algorithms like AES or bcrypt for passwords.\n\n 4.  Validate and Sanitize Header Data: Ensure headers are properly validated\n     and sanitized to prevent attacks like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or\n     Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfigurations.\n\n 5.  Handle Errors Sensibly: Abstain from giving away detailed error messages to\n     clients in a production environment. For public-facing APIs, use generic\n     messages, for instance.\n\n 6.  Employ Content Security Policy (CSP): Leverage CSP to define trusted\n     origins for assets, minimizing the risk of malicious injections like\n     cross-site scripting.\n\n 7.  Create Firewall Rules: Rather than solely relying on iptables, consider\n     using solutions like nftables for consistent traffic filtering.\n\n 8.  Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update Node.js and third-party\n     packages to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n 9.  Use Container Technologies: Embrace containers like Docker to help isolate\n     applications and shared infrastructure.\n\n 10. Utilize Reverse Proxies: Employ reverse proxies such as Nginx to serve\n     static assets and weed out malicious traffic before it reaches your\n     application.\n\n 11. Establish File Upload Limits and Restrictions: Only entertain a specific\n     range of file types, while restricting maximum file sizes.\n\n 12. Use HTTPS for Secure Communication: Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in\n     motion, obliging secure channels between the client and server.\n\n 13. Conduct Security Audits Routinely: Periodic scrutinization might expose\n     vulnerabilities that could be promptly fixed.

It's like a firewall, controlling all incoming\nresources.\n\nTo enforce CSP, use the helmet-csp middleware:\n\nPrerequisites: npm install helmet-csp\n\nImplementation:\n\nconst helmet = require('helmet');\napp.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({\n  directives: {\n    defaultSrc: [\"'self'\"],\n    styleSrc: [\"'self'\", 'maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com']\n  },\n}));\n\n\nXSS SANITIZATION LIBRARIES\n\nFrameworks like Angular and React come with built-in XSS protection. For others,\nuse libraries like sanitize-html:\n\nPrerequisites: npm install sanitize-html\n\nImplementation:\n\nconst sanitizeHTML = require('sanitize-html');\nconst dirty = '<script>hello</script>';\nconst clean = sanitizeHTML(dirty);\nconsole.log(clean);\n\n\nHTML ENTITY ENCODING\n\nMandatory: For all user or external data to be displayed in the HTML.\n\nThe escape-html library is a viable method. When rendering dynamic content in\nthe views/templates, use the {{{text}}} in pug or <%- invokeUnescapedFn(HTML) %>\nin the ejs template engine.\n\nPrerequisites: npm install escape-html\n\nImplementation:\n\nconst escapeHtml = require('escape-html');\nconst html = '<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>';\nconsole.log(escapeHtml(html));\n\n\nSTRICT DATA VALIDATION\n\nImplementation:\n\nUse libraries like joi in combination with middleware:\n\nconst Joi = require('joi');\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\nconst schema = {\n  user: Joi.object({\n    username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),\n    password: Joi.string().pattern(new RegExp('^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,30}$')).required(),\n  }),\n};\n\napp.post('/user', (req, res) => {\n  const { error, value } = schema.user.validate(req.body);\n  if (error) {\n    res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);\n    return;\n  }\n  // Logic to save user to the database\n  res.status(201).send(\"User registered successfully\");\n});\n\n// User validation with browser-originated data\nconst { error, value } = schema.user.validate({ username: '12', password: 'abc' });\nconsole.log(error);\n\n\nINPUT SANITIZATION\n\nAn important concept for node.js api security is user input validation and\nsanitization. To ensure the input data is safe to use, use reputed npm packages\nsuch as express-validator along with the middleware check and validationResult.\n\nPrerequisites: `npm install express-validator``\n\nSample Code:\n\n    const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');\n    //Customize the sanitization according to your input data\n    const usernameSanitizer = check('username').trim().escape().optional();\n    const passwordSanitizer = check('password').trim().escape().optional();\n\n\n\n    // Middleware: sanitizing & validating the fields\n    const sanitizeAndValidateFields = [\n      usernameSanitizer,\n      passwordSanitizer,\n      (req, res, next) => {\n        const errors = validationResult(req);\n        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n          return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });\n        }\n        next();\n      }\n    ];\n    \n    app.post('/', sanitizeAndValidateFields, (req, res) => {\n      res.send('Input is valid, processed data: ' + JSON.stringify(req.body));\n    });\n","index":51,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"53.\n\n\nWHAT ARE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND HOW COULD YOU USE THEM IN NODE.JS?","answer":"Environment variables provide a standardized way to manage configuration\nsettings for applications and services.\n\nIn the context of Node.js, they are especially useful for separating sensitive\ninformation and other environment-specific settings from code.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n\n * Security: Keeps sensitive data like API keys and database passwords out of\n   version control.\n * Flexibility: Facilitates dynamic configuration across different deployment\n   environments.\n * Portability: Unified configuration mechanism for all deployment platforms.\n\n\nSETTING UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n\nHere is a Node.js code:\n\nCode: Setting up Environment Variables in Node.js.\n\n// .env file\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_USER=root\nDB_PASS=s1mpl3\n\n// server.js\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nconst DB_HOST = process.env.DB_HOST;\nconst DB_USER = process.env.DB_USER;\nconst DB_PASS = process.env.DB_PASS;\n\n\n\nRULES FOR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE NAMES\n\n * Convention: All-uppercase variable names are conventional for environment\n   variables.\n * Data Types: Environment variables are strings by default, so any parsing or\n   data type conversion needs to be performed in the code.\n * Allowed Characters: Typically allows only letters, numbers, and underscores.\n   Many platforms disallow special characters or hyphens.\n\n\nUSING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN NODE.JS\n\n * process.env: Node.js global object that provides access to environment\n   variables.\n * dotenv Module: A Node.js module that reads from a .env file, allowing for\n   local development-specific variables without cluttering the source code.\n\n\nCAUTION WITH SENSITIVE INFORMATION\n\n * Encryption: It's a security best practice to secure sensitive information\n   even when stored in environment variables.\n * Restricted Access: Limit access to environment variable settings based on\n   need-to-know.\n\n\nTOOLS FOR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES MANAGEMENT\n\n * dotenv: Provides support for loading environment variables from a .env file\n   into process.env.\n * Configuration Tools: Many libraries and frameworks offer configuration\n   management mechanisms that can work with environment variables.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n\n 1.

Here is a comprehensive guide to handling versioning in a\nNode.js API.\n\n\nTYPES OF VERSIONING FOR NODE.JS APIS\n\nURI-BASED VERSIONING\n\n * Pros: Straightforward for both developers and servers. It's easily cacheable.\n * Cons: Can lead to complexity and confusion in large systems.\n * Example: https://api.example.com/v1/resource\n\nREQUEST HEADER-BASED VERSIONING\n\n * Pros: URL remains cleaner. Allows for focus on business logic.\n * Cons: Initial setup complexity.\n * Example: Set Accept: application/json; version=1.0 in the request headers.\n\n\nCONTENT NEGOTIATION AND REQUEST HEADERS\n\n * Use the Accept header for API internals. For example, Accept:\n   application/vnd.myapi.v2+json.\n * That way, when unsophisticated endpoints are requested, all data gets served,\n   but for nuanced endpoints, only the requested data gets served.\n * Use Content-Type for data sent in requests, and Accept for data requested in\n   responses.\n\n\nHANDLING VERSIONING\n\n * Manual Route-Based: Easiest to understand for small projects.\n * Use routes like /v1.0/webhook and /v1.1/webhook.\n * Dynamic Routes: Use the same URL pattern with different versions.\n * Example: /v1/webhook and /v2/webhook.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Semantic Versioning (SemVer): Abide by the SemVer standard for clarifying the\n   nature of changes, through versions like major.minor.patch.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: EXPRESS FRAMEWORK VERSION HANDLING\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/v1/hello', (req, res) => {\n    res.send('Hello from version 1!');\n});\n\napp.get('/v2/hello', (req, res) => {\n    res.send('Hello from version 2!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3001, () => console.log('Server running on port 3001'));\n","index":58,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"60.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SEMANTIC VERSIONING (SEMVER) AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN NODE.JS DEVELOPMENT?","answer":"Semantic Versioning (SemVer) provides a standardized way to declare\ncompatibility and release updates in software.

Predictability: Developers can foresee potential impacts of an update.\n 2. Quality Controls: Automated testing and Continuous Integration/Continuous\n    Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can leverage SemVer for selective, controlled\n    deployments.\n 3. Risk Mitigation: By distinguishing between patch, minor, and major releases,\n    SemVer aids in managing risks of instability arising from changes.\n 4.

They stand out for their low memory requirements,\nresponsiveness, and being especially useful with large data sets.\n\n\nKEY PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES OF NODE.JS STREAMS\n\n * Lower Memory Footprint: Streams process data in smaller, manageable chunks\n   rather than loading an entire data set into memory. This is particularly\n   beneficial when working with larger files or slower I/O processes.\n\n * Reduced Latency: The chunk-based approach means data is immediately\n   processed, leading to faster and more responsive I/O operations with a\n   consistent flow of data.\n\n * Parallel Processing: Node.js streams facilitate concurrent processing, often\n   supported by Node's Event Loop mechanism. This makes them faster for\n   I/O-bound tasks.\n\n * asynchronous and non-blocking: Node.js streams operate in a non-blocking\n   manner. This means they won't stall the system should a stream encounter an\n   I/O delay, allowing other tasks to continue.\n\n * End-to-End Efficiency: Rather than reading or writing data in its entirety,\n   streams enable real-time processing and transmission of data chunks. This\n   provides responsiveness and ensures no redundant data is unnecessarily stored\n   or transmitted.\n\n * Pipelining: Streams are designed to be sequential, making it simple to\n   establish processing pipelines without needing an intermediate buffer.\n\n * Back-Pressure Mechanism: Node.js streams automatically manage and control the\n   flow of data to prevent any potential overload between I/O operations.\n\n * Task Specific Memory Consumption: Certain stream instances, known as\n   Transform streams, only consume memory necessary to process chunks. This can\n   be a major benefit for processes that require reversible data transformation\n   such as compression or encryption.\n\n * Adaptability Across Different Data Sources: Streams operate in a consistent\n   manner and can be used cohesively with data from internet requests, file\n   systems, and databases.\n\n * Caching Minimization: Unique to transform streams, these components are\n   designed to minimize in-memory caching, further reducing memory operations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STREAM-LIKE PROCESSING\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Synchronous file read\nconst data = fs.readFileSync('inputFile.txt', 'utf-8');\n\n// Transforming data synchronously\nconst transformedData = data.toUpperCase();\n\n// Synchronous file write\nfs.writeFileSync('outputFile.txt', transformedData);\n\n\nThis code may not be ideal for larger files as it would block the Node.js\nprocess during I/O operations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING NODE.JS STREAMS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst { Transform, pipeline } = require('stream');\nconst { promisify } = require('util');\n\n// Using the \"pipeline\" utility for error handling and to resolve backpressure\nconst pump = promisify(pipeline);\n\n// Defining the Transform stream\nconst upperCaser = new Transform({\n  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {\n    this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());\n    callback();\n  }\n});\n\n// Setting up the pipeline - asynchronously\nasync function run() {\n  try {\n    await pump(\n      fs.createReadStream('inputFile.txt'),\n      upperCaser,\n      fs.createWriteStream('outputFile.txt')\n    );\n    console.log('Pipeline succeeded.');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Pipeline failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nrun();\n\n\nThis approach uses Node.js streams, offering asynchronous processing and reduced\nmemory consumption.","index":64,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"66.\n\n\nDESCRIBE SOME POPULAR FRAMEWORKS AND LIBRARIES IN THE NODE.JS ECOSYSTEM.","answer":"Node.js offers a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, catering to web\ndevelopment, APIs, databases, and more.\n\nChoose from a range of tools to streamline development, enhance performance,\nbolster security, and ensure cross-functional coordination.\n\n\nPOPULAR NODE.JS LIBRARIES & FRAMEWORKS\n\nExplore a variety of tools, libraries, and frameworks designed to streamline and\nenhance your Node.js applications.\n\nWEB FRAMEWORKS\n\n1. EXPRESS.JS\n\nExpress.js is the most commonly used web application framework for Node.js. It\nsimplifies the development of web applications and APIs with its minimalistic\napproach and robust features.\n\nThe middleware architecture provides a flexible foundation, empowering\ndevelopers to add third-party middleware for various functionalities such as\nauthentication, logging, and CORS handling.\n\nCode Example (Express app):\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/user', (req, res) => {\n  res.json({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30, id: 123 });\n});\n\napp.post('/user', (req, res) => {\n  // Process and save user data\n  res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created successfully' });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server started on port 3000');\n});\n\n\n2. KOA\n\nBuilt by the team behind Express, Koa provides a more modern and modular\napproach to middleware. By leveraging ES6's async/await syntax, it offers a\ncleaner, more expressive way to work with asynchronous code.\n\nCode Example (Koa app):\n\nconst Koa = require('koa');\nconst app = new Koa();\n\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  const start = Date.now();\n  await next();\n  const ms = Date.now() - start;\n  console.log(`${ctx.method} ${ctx.url} - ${ms}ms`);\n});\n\napp.use(async ctx => {\n  ctx.body = 'Hello, Koa!';\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n\n\nDATABASE LIBRARIES\n\n3. MONGOOSE\n\nMongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to simplify interactions\nwith MongoDB. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution for modeling\napplications, including advanced features such as validation, type casting, and\nmore.\n\nCode Example (Mongoose Schema & Model):\n\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;\n\n// Define a schema\nconst userSchema = new Schema({\n  firstName: String,\n  lastName: String,\n  age: Number\n});\n\n// Compile the model\nconst User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);\n\n// Create and save a user\nconst newUser = new User({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30 });\nnewUser.save();\n\n\n4. SEQUELIZE\n\nSequelize serves as a powerful, multi-dialect ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)\nlibrary for Node.js. It's compatible with various SQL databases like MySQL,\nPostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. Sequelize offers support for migrations,\ntransactions, and intricate query functionality.\n\nCode Example (Sequelize Model & Data Access):\n\nconst { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');\n// Define the connection and models\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:');\n\nconst User = sequelize.define('User', {\n  firstName: {\n    type: DataTypes.STRING,\n    allowNull: false\n  },\n  lastName: {\n    type: DataTypes.STRING\n  },\n  age: {\n    type: DataTypes.INTEGER\n  }\n});\n\n// Create and save a user\nsequelize.sync()\n  .then(() => User.create({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30 }));\n\n\nTESTING\n\n5. JEST\n\nJest is a delightful testing framework, particularly optimized for simplicity\nand speed, ensuring quick feedback during code modifications. It's equipped with\nfeatures such as snapshot testing, mocking, and parallel test execution.\n\nCode Example (Jest Test):\n\n// test.js\nconst sum = require('./sum');\n\ntest('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n});\n\n// sum.js\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = sum;\n\n\nTASK RUNNERS AND BUILD TOOLS\n\n6. GULP\n\nGulp excels as an automation toolkit best suited for frontend and Node.js tasks.\nIt leverages a stream-based approach for efficient file manipulation,\ncontrasting with other tools that manage tasks entirely in memory.\n\nGulp's modularity encourages the use of numerous plugins, covering a multitude\nof needs, for instance, minifying assets or running tasks in a particular order.\n\nExample of Gulp Task:\n\nconst gulp = require('gulp');\nconst minify = require('gulp-minify');\n\ngulp.task('compress', function() {\n  return gulp.src('src/*.js')\n    .pipe(minify())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n\n\n7. WEBPACK\n\nPopularly recognized as a module bundler, Webpack processes application source\ncode, culminating in fewer, optimized files for production deployment. It\ncleverly handles resources like JavaScript, CSS, images, and even fonts, thereby\nstreamlining their dependencies.\n\nWebpack Configuration (webpack.config.js):\n\nconst path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')\n  }\n};\n\n\nAUTHENTICATION AND SECURITY\n\n8. PASSPORT\n\nPassport is the go-to library for authentication activities. Renowned for its\nmodular strategy, it supports a plenitude of authentication techniques like\nusername/password, OAuth, and more via its comprehensive list of custom\nstrategies.\n\nIncorporating Passport equips your Express or Connect web apps with secure,\nefficient authentication.\n\nExample of Passport Middleware:\n\napp.post('/login', \n  passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/',\n                                   failureRedirect: '/login',\n                                   failureFlash: true })\n);\n","index":65,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"67.\n\n\nHOW IS KOA DIFFERENT FROM EXPRESS.JS?","answer":"Koa and Express.js are both server-side Node.js frameworks, but they have\ndistinct design philosophies, middleware systems, and control flow mechanisms.\n\n\nCORE DIFFERENCES\n\n * Size: Koa is smaller, providing only essential features.

Install Dependencies:\n    \n    npm install express express-graphql graphql\n    \n\n 2. Express Integration:\n    \n    const express = require('express');\n    const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');\n    const { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString } = require('graphql');\n    \n    const app = express();\n    \n    const queryType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n        name: 'Query',\n        fields: {\n            hello: {\n                type: GraphQLString,\n                resolve: () => 'Hello, World!'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    \n    const schema = new GraphQLSchema({ query: queryType });\n    \n    app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({ schema, graphiql: true }));\n    app.listen(4000, () => console.log('Server running on localhost:4000/graphql'));\n    \n\n 3. Test using GraphiQL:\n    Visit http://localhost:4000/graphql to query and explore.\n\nINTEGRATING DATA SOURCES\n\n * Connectors: Tools like dataloader help with batching and caching, ensuring\n   optimized data retrieval from databases or APIs.\n\n * Type Resolvers: Resolve how specific types should load their data. For\n   instance, if you have an author field on a book type, a resolver can indicate\n   where the corresponding author data comes from.\n\n\nSCHEMA DEFINITION\n\nGraphQL follows a schema-first approach, detailing the available data structures\nand their potential relationships.\n\nHere's a sample schema for a \"Library\" system, using GraphQL's Schema Definition\nLanguage:\n\ntype Author {\n   id: ID!\n   name: String!\n   books: [Book]!\n}\n\ntype Book {\n   id: ID!\n   title: String!\n   author: Author!\n}\n\ntype Query {\n   book(id: ID!): Book\n   books: [Book]!\n}\n\n\nIn Node.js, the schema is defined within the server, serving as the primary data\ncontract between the client and the server.\n\nDATA RESOLVERS\n\nGraphQL resolvers are the server-side functions that fetch the necessary data\nfor a particular field. By default, the GraphQL server expects each field in a\nschema to have a corresponding resolver.\n\nHere's a simple example of resolvers matching the previously defined schema:\n\nconst resolvers = {\n   Query: {\n       book: (_, { id }) => getBookById(id),\n       books: () => getAllBooks(),\n   },\n   Book: { \n       author: (book) => getAuthorById(book.authorId),\n   },\n   Author: {\n       books: (author) => getBooksByAuthorId(author.id),\n   },\n};\n\n\nEach resolver function corresponds directly to a field in the schema definition.\nWhen a client requests specific data, these resolver functions are executed to\nretrieve it.\n\nGRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GRAPHIQL)\n\nGraphiQL is a graphical, in-browser IDE for exploring and interacting with a\nGraphQL endpoint.\n\nIt's a helpful tool for both server development and client testing, providing a\nstraightforward, autocompleting interface for constructing and firing off\nGraphQL queries.","index":71,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"73.\n\n\nHOW DOES NODE.JS INTERACT WITH FRONTEND FRAMEWORKS LIKE ANGULAR OR REACT?","answer":"Node.js typically serves as a back-end runtime environment. When co-existing\nwith Angular or React, Node.js streamlines operations and facilitates smooth\ncommunication between the front and back ends.\n\n\nNPM AND PACKAGE MANAGEMENT\n\n * Role: NPM (Node Package Manager) is the go-to tool for handling dependencies.\n   Both Node.js server and Angular/React app use it, allowing tracking and\n   synchronization of package versions.\n\n * Integration: Through JSON-based configurations (package.json files).\n   \n   For Angular or React apps, NPM is utilized during the initial setup. The\n   respective package.json file manages app-level dependencies.\n   \n   On the Node.js end, it deals with server-specific packages, configurations,\n   and modules for any client-side components, such as build tools.\n\n\nBUILD AND COMPILATION TOOLS\n\n * Role: These tools are crucial for processing assets, running tests, and\n   improving app performance.\n\n * Integration: They are operated through Node.js scripts, which can be\n   customized.\n   \n   For instance, utilities like Babel for ECMAScript transpiling, or webpack for\n   bundling, are managed through the server, using scripts in the package.json\n   file.\n   \n   Node.js commands help orchestrate these pre-deployment tasks.\n\n\nRESTFUL APIS AND WEBSOCKETS\n\n * Role: Node.js acts as an intermediary, facilitating data exchange between the\n   server and the client.\n\n * Integration: Node.js servers, often with the support of frameworks like\n   Express.js, set forth and maintain RESTful APIs or bi-directional\n   communication channels using WebSockets.\n   \n   Angular and React components communicate with these APIs to perform\n   operations like data retrieval, updates, and deletions.\n\n\nCODE EXECUTION PIPELINE IN NODE.JS WITH FRONTEND FRAMEWORKS\n\nNode.js, Angular, and React work together in a streamlined pipeline:\n\n 1. Initial Setup: All three use a shared system of package management (NPM),\n    although each will have its own specific package file.\n\n 2. Development Stage: During app construction, the top-level front-end\n    framework configures the Node.js server. This setup enables various tasks\n    such as code transpilation, compilation, and bundling.\n\n 3. Run-Time Operation: When the app is deployed, Node.js serves as the\n    back-end, processing server-specific requests and offering API endpoints or\n    WebSockets for client interactions.\n\n 4. Error Handling and Logging: Both front- and back-end components contribute\n    to the unified debugging network. Node.js is equipped with asynchronous\n    utilities like Promises and async/await to handle errors, which may stem\n    from the client.\n\n 5. Process Termination: Node.js boasts a comprehensive life-cycle management\n    system. Front- and back-end components ensure a smooth transition should the\n    need arise to shut down the server, clearing up resources and finishing\n    ongoing operations.\n\nConcurrency management during heavy server loads is particularly facilitated by\nNode.js, addressing issues related to event loop efficiency, thread pooling, and\neven worker threads when necessary.","index":72,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"74.\n\n\nWHAT IS SERVER-SIDE RENDERING AND HOW CAN IT BE ACHIEVED WITH NODE.JS?","answer":"Server-side rendering in Node.js refers to generating and serving web content as\ncomplete HTML pages from the server. This stands in contrast to client-side\nrendering, which typically happens inside a web browser using JavaScript.\n\nThere are several techniques to accomplish server-side rendering with Node.js,\nsuch as using template engines or modern frameworks that offer built-in support\nfor server-side rendering.\n\n\nTECHNIQUES FOR SERVER-SIDE RENDERING\n\n 1. Traditional Server-Side Rendering: This approach uses template engines like\n    EJS, Pug, or Handlebars to embed dynamic content within HTML.\n\n 2. Virtual DOM Rendering: Virtual DOM libraries such as React and Preact now\n    offer server-side rendering capabilities. These libraries can build the\n    initial user interface on the server and then rehydrate it on the client.\n\n 3. Streaming and Buffering: Node.js can use Writable streams or buffers to send\n    HTML content to clients progressively. This is particularly useful for large\n    datasets.\n\n 4. Hybrid Rendering: Some frameworks, like Next.js, combine the best of\n    server-side rendering and client-side rendering into a seamless experience.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SERVER-SIDE RENDERING WITH EJS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nAPP.JS\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// Set the view engine to EJS\napp.set('view engine', 'ejs');\n\n// Render the EJS template centrally\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.render('index', { title: 'Server-side Rendering with EJS' });\n});\n\n// Express to listen on port 3000\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server running on port 3000');\n});\n\n\nINDEX.EJS\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title><%= title %></title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Welcome to <%= title %></h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nWhen a user navigates to the home page of this server, the index.ejs template\ngets rendered with its dynamic data and returned as a complete HTML page.","index":73,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"75.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME CODING CONVENTIONS AND BEST PRACTICES IN NODE.JS?","answer":"When it comes to Node.js, several coding conventions and best practices can\nstreamline your development process and improve the overall quality of your\ncode.\n\n\nCONSISTENCY AND CLARITY\n\nConsistency in code structure and naming conventions, along with clear\ndocumentation, can ease code maintenance and improve team collaboration.\n\n * Use const whenever possible. Reserve let for variables you'll need to\n   reassign.\n * Avoid using var in ES6. This is particularly relevant in Node.js, which\n   supports recent JavaScript language features.\n * Adhere to camelCase for functions and variable names.\n\n\nERROR HANDLING\n\nRobust error handling and clear error messages are essential for an\napplication's stability and usability.\n\n * Utilize try-catch blocks in synchronous code to capture and manage\n   exceptions.\n\n * For asynchronous functions, consistently handle promises with both then and\n   catch or use async/await for cleaner error management.\n   \n   // Using Promises\n   myPromise()\n     .then(successHandler)\n     .catch(errorHandler);\n   \n   // Using async/await\n   try {\n     let result = await myAsyncFunction();\n   } catch (err) {\n     console.error(err);\n   }\n   \n\n * Always use descriptive error messages, aiding debugging and troubleshooting.\n\n\nHANDLING SENSITIVE DATA\n\n * Store sensitive data, such as API keys and database passwords, in a dedicated\n   .env file in the root directory of your project. Use a package like dotenv to\n   manage and load this data.\n\n# .env file\nSOME_API_KEY=abcdef12345\n\n\n\nMODULES AND DEPENDENCIES\n\nEfficiently managing Node.js modules and packages can enhance your project's\nmaintainability and scalability.\n\n * Keep module paths relative, omitting ./ or ../ whenever possible.\n\n * Sort and categorize your package.json dependencies for readability.\n   \n   {\n     \"dependencies\": {\n       \"express\": \"*\",\n       \"mongoose\": \"*\"\n     },\n     \"devDependencies\": {\n       \"mocha\": \"*\",\n       \"eslint\": \"*\"\n     }\n   }\n   \n\n * Regularly update your dependencies with tools such as npm update. This helps\n   prevent security vulnerabilities and keeps your modules current.\n\n\nCODE DOCUMENTATION AND COMMENTS\n\nClear, concise, and updated code documentation is crucial for understanding,\nmaintaining, and scaling your applications.\n\n * Employ meaningful function and variable names, reducing the need for\n   excessive comments.\n\n * Use JSDoc comments, particularly when exposing APIs. This provides\n   descriptive function signatures and return types for IDEs and developers\n   using your code.\n   \n   /**\n    * Returns the sum of two numbers.\n    *\n    * @param {number} a - The first number.\n    * @param {number} b - The second number.\n    * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.\n    */\n   function add(a, b) {\n       return a + b;\n   }\n   \n\n\nASYNC/AWAIT VS.

Let's explore how to ensure adherence\nto these principles in a Node.js context.\n\n\nCODEBASE\n\nVoice of Code: Maintain dedicated Git repositories for each microservice or\ncomponent. Ensure that core configuration like environment variables or secrets\ndynamically fetched during runtime and not hardcoded into the code.\n\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nVoice of Code: Highly important. Leverage a Node.js package manager (such as npm\nor yarn) to declare all application-level software dependencies. Record both\nexact versions for production and looser ranges for development and deployment\nprocesses in package.json.\n\n\nCONFIG\n\nVoice of Code: Don't hardcode any configuration settings into code. Use\nenvironment variables or parameter store solutions like AWS Systems Manager to\nstore configuration details.\n\n\nBACKING SERVICES\n\nVoice of Code: Treat backing services as attached resources. Your app should be\nable to switch databases or external services without code modifications. The\nchoice of database or service should be available entirely via configuration.\n\n\nBUILD, RELEASE, RUN\n\nVoice of Code: Decouple build and run stages. Use npm or yarn scripts to\nseparate build actions (transpilation, minification, etc.) from the running\nscript. Use a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for\nconsistent releases.\n\n\nPROCESSES\n\nVoice of Code: Use Node.js cluster module or process managers like PM2 to manage\nmultiple application instances. Centralize logging and error handling across\ninstances.\n\n\nPORT BINDING\n\nVoice of Code: In non-containerized environments, your app might receive a\nrandom port from the environment. In containerized environments, have the\nflexibility to bind to a specific port. Listen on the port provided by the\nenvironment or use a default.\n\n\nCONCURRENCY\n\nVoice of Code: Design your Node.js application to be stateless and ensure that\nmultiple independent processes can run the same codebase.

It's particularly useful for building\ndistributed and concurrent systems, making it an excellent fit for microservices\narchitectures.\n\n\nCENTRAL ROLE IN NODE.JS ECOSYSTEM\n\nZeroMQ has gained wide popularity in Node.js programming thanks to its\nexceptional capabilities in facilitating inter-process communication. It can\noutperform traditional network sockets by providing advanced communication\npatterns and supporting streamlining, which is advantageous in the context of\nhigh-velocity messaging systems.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Socket Abstraction: ZeroMQ simplifies socket management, offering a cohesive\n   interface regardless of the underlying transport mechanism. This uniformity\n   enables easier code management, especially in systems that require multiple\n   transport types.\n * Message Aggregation: ZeroMQ allows bundling multiple messages into a single,\n   unified structure for improved efficiency in transmission. This feature is\n   particularly beneficial when systems need to handle numerous small messages\n   repetitively.\n * Brokerless Operations: ZeroMQ doesn't mandate the use of centralized message\n   brokers, helping developers minimize architectural complexities in\n   distributed systems.\n\n\nHIGH-LEVEL PATTERNS\n\nZeroMQ is distinguished by its support for several advanced communication\npatterns, which are not efficiently achievable using standard UDP/TCP socket\nmechanisms. For instance:\n\n * Request-Reply: Applications can maintain synchronous bidirectional data\n   flows, resembling typical user-webserver interactions.\n * Publish-Subscribe: Systems can efficiently manage broadcast message\n   propagation to many interested subscribers.\n * Push-Pull: This pattern is well-suited for load balancing among multiple\n   worker nodes.\n\n\nMULTI-THREADING AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT\n\nWhile Node.js offers a predominantly single-threaded execution model, ZeroMQ\nbecomes especially valuable in scenarios requiring concurrent data processing.\nThrough its multi-threading capabilities, ZeroMQ can handle concurrent I/O\noperations across numerous sockets. This feature allows Node.js programs,\nespecially ones employing the child_process module, to distribute work among\nworker threads or distinct child processes efficiently.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: PUB-SUB MECHANISM\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\n// Publisher\nconst zmq = require(\"zeromq\");\nconst sock = new zmq.Publisher();\n\nsock.bind(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:3000\", err => {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\"Publisher bound to port 3000\");\n});\n\nsetInterval(() => {\n  console.log(\"Sent message to subscribers\");\n  sock.send(\"Awesome news for subscribers!\");\n}, 1000);\n\n// Subscriber 1\nconst subscriber1 = new zmq.Subscriber();\nsubscriber1.connect(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:3000\");\nsubscriber1.subscribe(\"topicA\");\nsubscriber1.on(\"message\", msg => {\n  console.log(\"subscriber1 received a message related to topicA:\", msg.toString());\n});\n\n// Subscriber 2\nconst subscriber2 = new zmq.Subscriber();\nsubscriber2.connect(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:3000\");\nsubscriber2.subscribe(\"topicB\");\n\nsubscriber2.on(\"message\", msg => {\n  console.log(\"subscriber2 received a message related to topicB:\", msg.toString());\n});\n\n\nIn this example, you can see a simplified Pub-Sub communication pattern using\nZeroMQ in a Node.js program.

Here are strategies for mitigating this issue.\n\n\nOFFLOADING COMPUTATION\n\nOne effective strategy is to delegate high-compute operations to external\nresources. This approach enhances the concurrency and responsiveness of the\nNode.js application.\n\n * Cloud Services: Leverage platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions,\n   or Azure Functions for on-demand task execution.\n\n * Dedicated Servers: Set up dedicated computational servers, known as Worker\n   Servers, to handle computational tasks and return results to the main Node.js\n   application.\n\n * Microservices: Implement supporting microservices that specialize in\n   strenuous computations. Microservices can run independently, taking advantage\n   of all the available physical or virtual resources.\n\n\nMULTITHREADING AND WORKER THREADS\n\nNode.js traditionally has a single-threaded event loop. However, for scenarios\ndemanding native threading, you can rely on Node.js' worker threads or\ntechnologies like Web Workers in the context of web servers.\n\n * Worker Threads: Introduced as an experimental feature in Node.js 10, worker\n   threads provide native support for spawning threads. Ensure you thoroughly\n   test your application's behavior when utilizing this feature.\n\n * pThreads: Node.js libraries such as node-webworker-threads, utilize POSIX\n   threads to drive multithreading within a Node.js application. When this\n   mechanism is used, the JavaScript code is executed within the context of\n   these threads.\n\n\nCACHING INTERMEDIATE VALUES\n\nFrequent recomputation of static results is an unwanted overhead burden. The\napplication can keep hold of these unchanging results using appropriate\nstrategies.\n\n * Memorization: Especially helpful for repetitive function calls, memorization\n   ensures that each input is associated with a cached result to reduce\n   redundant calculations. Libraries like lodash offer this functionality.\n\n * Application-Level Caching: Use platforms like Redis to store and retrieve\n   interim or static results that don't need constant recomputation. This\n   strategy optimizes performance for both computation-heavy and data-intensive\n   applications.\n\n\nSCHEDULING NON-CRITICAL TASKS\n\nWhen the system isn't under active user engagement, you can intelligently\ndistribute intense computation over periods of low activity to minimize\nimmediate performance impairments.\n\n * Task Schedulers: For real-time tasks that can endure slight latencies, you\n   can schedule them or defer their execution. Libraries such as node-schedule\n   or languages like TypeScript help organize this behavior.\n\n * Queue Systems: With streamlined task management, queues can concisely\n   sequence and channel process executions. Redis and efficient message brokers\n   like RabbitMQ are instrumental in achieving task queueing.\n\n\nCODE INSIGHTS\n\nUSING WORKER THREADS FOR CPU-BOUND TASKS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');\n\nif (isMainThread) {\n  const worker = new Worker(__filename);\n  worker.on('message', value => console.log(`Received message: ${value}`));\n  worker.postMessage('Hello from main thread!');\n} else {\n  parentPort.on('message', value => {\n    console.log(`Received message from main thread: ${value}`);\n    parentPort.postMessage('Hello from worker thread!');\n  });\n}\n\n\nUSING LRU CACHE FOR MEMORY-BOUND TASKS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst { LRUMap } = require('lru_map');\n// We set the cache size to 1000 entries\nconst cache = new LRUMap(1000);\n\nfunction computeAndCacheResult(input) {\n  if (cache.has(input)) {\n    return cache.get(input);\n  }\n\n  const result = computeResult(input);\n  cache.set(input, result);\n  \n  return result;\n}\n\n\nUSING REDIS FOR APPLICATION-LEVEL CACHING\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst redis = require('redis');\nconst client = redis.createClient();\n\nfunction getCachedOrComputeResult(input, callback) {\n  client.get(input, (err, reply) => {\n    if (err) {\n      return callback(err);\n    }\n    if (reply) {\n      return callback(null, reply);\n    }\n    \n    const result = computeResult(input);\n    client.set(input, result);\n    callback(null, result);\n  });\n}\n","index":92,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"94.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF A NODE.JS APPLICATION IN DEVOPS?","answer":"Node.js plays a pivotal role in DevOps, facilitating streamlined collaboration\nbetween development and operations teams.

Use hyphens for readability when needed but avoid underscores.\n\n\nUSE OF HTTP METHODS\n\n * GET for retrieving data.\n * POST for creating new resources or performing actions.\n * PUT or PATCH for updating or modifying data.\n * DELETE for removing data.\n\n\nHANDLE HTTP STATUS CODES\n\nUse meaningful HTTP status codes to convey the outcome of the API call. For\ninstance, 200 for a successful request and 404 for resource not found.\n\n\nREQUEST AND RESPONSE\n\n * For data submissions, use either application/x-www-form-urlencoded or\n   application/json.\n * Always send back appropriate JSON responses to both successful and failed\n   requests.\n * Keep response-data and meta-information separate. Prefer having a predictable\n   data key for payloads.\n\n\nERROR HANDLING\n\n * Instead of long-winded error messages, maintain a consistent error structure\n   (like specifying a message and a status code).\n * Configure middleware that centralizes error handling. Additionally, use\n   libraries such as express-validator for input validation.\n\n\nRESTFUL API URI, HTTP METHODS & STATUS CODE MAPPINGS\n\nResource URI Path HTTP Method Status Code Example Collection of Resources (e.g.\nusers) /users GET 200 GET users A Specific Resource (e.g. user with ID 1)\n/users/1 GET 200/404 GET user with ID 1 Collection Creation (e.g. create a user)\n/users POST 201/400 POST - Create a user Resource Update (e.g. update user with\nID 1) /users/1 PUT 200/404/400 PUT - Update user with ID 1 Resource Deletion\n(e.g. delete user with ID 1) /users/1 DELETE 200/404 DELETE user with ID 1\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: RESTFUL API URI\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/users', (req, res) => {\n    // GET /users - Retrieve all users\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Retrieved all users.' });\n});\n\napp.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {\n    // GET /users/123 - Retrieve user with ID 123\n    const userId = req.params.id;\n    if (userId === '123') {\n        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Retrieved user with ID 123.' });\n    } else {\n        res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found.' });\n    }\n});\n\napp.post('/users', (req, res) => {\n    // POST /users - Create a new user\n    // ...\n    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created.' });\n});\n\napp.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {\n    // PUT /users/123 - Update user with ID 123\n    const userId = req.params.id;\n    // ...\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'User updated.' });\n});\n\napp.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {\n    // DELETE /users/123 - Delete user with ID 123\n    const userId = req.params.id;\n    // ...\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'User deleted.' });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n});\n","index":99,"topic":" Node.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
