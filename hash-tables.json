This\ntriggers the following:\n\n * Rehashing: Every key-value pair is reassigned to a new bucket, often using a\n   new hash function.\n * Reallocating memory: The internal data structure grows or shrinks to ensure a\n   better balance between load factor and performance.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Insertions: As the load factor increases, the number of insertions before\n   rehashing decreases. Consequently, insertions can be faster with a smaller\n   load factor, albeit with a compromise on memory efficiency.\n * Retrievals: In a well-maintained hash table, retrievals are expected to be\n   faster with a smaller load factor.\n\nHowever, these ideal situations might not hold in practice due to these factors:\n\n * Cache Efficiency: A smaller load factor might result in better cache\n   performance, ultimately leading to improved lookup speeds.\n\n * Access Patterns: If insertions and deletions are frequent, a higher load\n   factor might be preferable to avoid frequent rehashing, which can lead to\n   performance overhead.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LOAD FACTOR AND REHASHING\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nclass HashTable:\n    def __init__(self, initial_size=16, load_factor_threshold=0.75):\n        self.initial_size = initial_size\n        self.load_factor_threshold = load_factor_threshold\n        self.buckets = [None] * initial_size\n        self.num_entries = 0\n\n    def insert(self, key, value):\n        # Code for insertion\n        self.num_entries += 1\n        current_load_factor = self.num_entries / self.initial_size\n        if current_load_factor > self.load_factor_threshold:\n            self.rehash()\n\n    def rehash(self):\n        new_size = self.initial_size * 2  # Doubling the size\n        new_buckets = [None] * new_size\n        # Code for rehashing\n        self.buckets = new_buckets\n","index":12,"topic":" Hash Tables ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"14.\n\n\nDISCUSS DIFFERENT WAYS TO RESIZE A HASH TABLE.

It uses two hash functions and is\nparticularly suited for in-memory applications where lookup times matter most.\n\n\nHOW CUCKOO HASHING WORKS\n\n 1. Setup: You have two hash functions, h1(x)h_1(x)h1 (x) and h2(x)h_2(x)h2 (x),\n    and two hash tables, Table 1 and Table 2, each with its own unique hash\n    function.\n\n 2. Insertion: When you add a key, kkk, to the data set, Cuckoo Hashing first\n    tries placing the key at position h1(k)h_1(k)h1 (k) in Table 1. If that slot\n    is already occupied, the existing key is \"kicked out,\" and the new key is\n    placed there. The kicked-out key is then inserted into Table 2 using the\n    second hash function: h2(k)h_2(k)h2 (k).\n\n 3. Lookup: You check both potential positions for the key, h1(k)h_1(k)h1 (k)\n    and h2(k)h_2(k)h2 (k). If the key is at neither position, it's not in the\n    set. This way, false negatives are avoided.\n\n 4. Deletion: When a key is deleted, both positions h1(k)h_1(k)h1 (k) and\n    h2(k)h_2(k)h2 (k) for the key are marked as unoccupied simultaneously. This\n    ensures the operation completes within O(1)O(1)O(1) time.\n\n 5. Algorithm Constraint: The behavior is specified through a set of parameters,\n    and if the algorithm hits a predefined maximum number of iterations without\n    finding a solution, the hash tables are rebuilt with new hash functions.\n\n\nADVANTAGE AND USE CASES\n\n * Memory Efficiency: Cuckoo Hashing uses no additional space for chaining or\n   collision resolution, which makes it memory efficient.\n * Predictable Performance: Cuckoo Hashing provides constant-time operations in\n   many scenarios, which is especially useful in high-performance applications\n   and real-time systems.\n * Simplicity: The algorithm is relatively simple to implement and understand.\n * Cache-Friendliness: By minimizing the need for linked data structures and\n   keeping the data more contiguous, Cuckoo Hashing can exploit cache locality\n   better than other hashing techniques. This can result in fewer cache misses\n   and better performance in some scenarios.\n\nHowever, Cuckoo Hashing has certain limitations and use case considerations:\n\n * Insertion Complexity: While the amortized cost of an insertion is\n   O(1)O(1)O(1), in the worst case, rehashing may be needed, requiring what's\n   effectively an O(n)O(n)O(n) operation.\n * Offline vs. Online Construction: Cuckoo Hashing is an online algorithm,\n   meaning that it constructs the hash tables while processing the input keys.\n   This can lead to poor performance due to many rehashing operations if not\n   implemented carefully.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CUCKOO HASHING\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ndef hash_func_1(key):\n    return key % 7\n\ndef hash_func_2(key):\n    return (key // 7) % 7  # Nested division to spread the values\n\ndef cuckoo_insert(tables, key, hash_func_1, hash_func_2, max_rehash_attempts=5):\n    for _ in range(max_rehash_attempts):\n        slot_1, slot_2 = hash_func_1(key), hash_func_2(key)\n        if tables[0][slot_1] is None:\n            tables[0][slot_1] = key\n            return True\n        elif tables[1][slot_2] is None: \n            tables[1][slot_2] = key\n            return True\n        else:\n            # Evict first slot, reinsert evicted key, and keep going\n            rehash_key = tables[0][slot_1]\n            tables[0][slot_1] = key\n            key = rehash_key\n    else:\n        return False  # Too many rehash attempts, consider rebuilding the tables\n\ndef cuckoo_lookup(tables, key, hash_func_1, hash_func_2):\n    slot_1, slot_2 = hash_func_1(key), hash_func_2(key)\n    return key in (tables[0][slot_1], tables[1][slot_2])\n\ndef cuckoo_delete(tables, key, hash_func_1, hash_func_2):\n    slot_1, slot_2 = hash_func_1(key), hash_func_2(key)\n    if tables[0][slot_1] == key:\n        tables[0][slot_1] = None\n    elif tables[1][slot_2] == key:\n        tables[1][slot_2] = None\n    return True\n\n# Initialize two tables with 7 slots each\ntable_1 = [None] * 7\ntable_2 = [None] * 7\ntables = (table_1, table_2)\n\n# Insert, lookup, and delete keys\ncuckoo_insert(tables, 42, hash_func_1, hash_func_2)  # Example of an insertion\nis_present = cuckoo_lookup(tables, 42, hash_func_1, hash_func_2)  # Example of a lookup\ncuckoo_delete(tables, 42, hash_func_1, hash_func_2)  # Example of a deletion\n","index":29,"topic":" Hash Tables ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"31.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SKIP LISTS AND HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO HASH TABLES?","answer":"Skip Lists offer a balanced compromise between the deterministic nature of\nBinary Search Trees and the stochastic efficiency of Hash Tables.\n\n\nDATA STRUCTURE\n\nSkip Lists use a linked list at each level.

Although efficient\nfor infrequent changes, frequent updates to the dataset may not be feasible.\n\nINCREMENTAL UPDATE\n\nThis updates the DPHT with newly added keys in a less time-consuming manner.\nHowever, consistent re-hashing might lead to the classification, filtering, and\nessentializing stages requiring time.\n\nWAYS FOR DATA SET DECLINE\n\n * Record Deletion: On deletion, a 'tombstone' key or value replaces the deleted\n   record, indicating the free space. However, over time, this leads to\n   inefficiencies and increased chances of collisions.\n * Reconstruction: Aggregating frequent deletions and rebuilding the DPHT might\n   resolve issues related to tombstones.

Hash Tables, on the other hand, give actual data when it's\n   present and \"nothing\" when it isn't.\n\n * Space Efficiency: Bloom Filters tend to occupy less space, particularly when\n   managing very large datasets, at the cost of false positives.\n\n * No Deletions: Bloom Filters are append-only, meaning they don't support item\n   deletions, and removing items can harm the integrity of the filter.\n\n * I/O Reduction: In scenarios with costly data access (like databases or\n   disk-based systems), Bloom Filters can substantially decrease the number of\n   unnecessary \"reads.\"\n\n\nUSE-CASES FOR BLOOM FILTERS\n\n 1. Databases: Bloom Filters can optimize disk I/O by preliminarily flagging\n    records that might be on disk.\n\n 2. Cache Assemblies: They're useful for acknowledging whether cache might\n    contain a record or not before launching a secondary cache search or asking\n    the back end.\n\n 3.

For instance, in Python, you can obtain sorted words from a\n   trie-based dictionary using depth-first traversal.\n\n * Longest-Prefix Matching: Tries stand out when identifying the longest common\n   prefix, a feature indispensable for tasks like text auto-completion or\n   network routing. As an example, search engines can expedite query suggestions\n   based on the longest matching prefix.\n\n * Consistent Insertion Speed: Tries offer a stable average-case insertion\n   performance. This consistent behavior is attractive for latency-sensitive\n   tasks. Contrarily, hash tables might necessitate occasional, time-intensive\n   resizing operations.\n\n * Superior Performance with Small Keys: For small keys, such as integers or\n   pointers, tries can be more efficient than hash tables. Their simpler tree\n   structures remove the overhead related to intricate hash functions in hash\n   tables.\n\n\nCOMPLEXITY COMPARISON\n\nTIME COMPLEXITY\n\n * Hash Tables: On average, they have O(1) O(1) O(1) lookup time.

It uses a hash index to separate data into distinct storage\npartitions or \"buckets\" for quick access.\n\nThe method offers an efficient way to balance storage load distribution and is\nparticularly well-suited for disk-based storage systems.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n 1. Hash Index: Composes the primary data structure. It maps keys to their\n    corresponding buckets.\n 2. Buckets: Serve as containers for the actual data. When the load on a bucket\n    exceeds a certain threshold, it gets divided into two, effectively\n    distributing the load.\n\n\nPROCESS FLOW\n\n 1. Initialization: The hashing system begins with a single bucket (B0).\n 2. Data Entry: Incoming data is hashed, and its modulo result w.r.t. the number\n    of active buckets determines its placement. When a bucket exceeds its load\n    capacity, it's divided, causing new buckets to be created.\n 3. Splitting Mechanism: Linear Hashing employs a \"next-to-split\" pointer, which\n    specifies the next bucket to be divided. Once a split occurs, this pointer\n    is adjusted for the immediate next split event.\n 4. Consistency: For data consistency, recently divided buckets are still\n    connected, and their loads are distributed over the new and original\n    buckets.\n 5. Adjusting Size: To accommodate growing datasets, the system periodically\n    increases the number of visible buckets. This expansion step is controlled\n    by a system-wide splitting factor.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Dynamic Sizing: Linear Hashing adjusts its size based on the growth of the\n   dataset, ensuring efficient memory management.\n * Low Overhead: The need for frequent resizing, compared to other dynamic\n   storage techniques, is relatively low.\n * Memory Efficiency: It's resource-conserving, particularly beneficial for\n   disk-based systems.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LINEAR HASHING\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nclass LinearHashing:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.buckets = [{}]\n        self.next_to_split = 0\n        self.splitting_factor = 2\n\n    def hash_function(self, key):\n        # Implement your own hash function\n        return hash(key) % len(self.buckets)\n\n    def insert(self, key, value):\n        bucket_id = self.hash_function(key)\n\n        self.buckets[bucket_id][key] = value\n\n        if len(self.buckets[bucket_id]) > self.splitting_factor:\n            self.split_bucket(bucket_id)\n\n    def split_bucket(self, bucket_id):\n        if bucket_id == self.next_to_split:\n            self.buckets.append({})\n            self.next_to_split += 1\n\n        for data in list(self.buckets[bucket_id]):\n            if self.hash_function(data) == len(self.buckets):\n                self.buckets[-1][data] = self.buckets[bucket_id][data]\n                del self.buckets[bucket_id][data]\n\n    def get(self, key):\n        bucket_id = self.hash_function(key)\n        return self.buckets[bucket_id].get(key)\n","index":36,"topic":" Hash Tables ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"38.\n\n\nHOW ARE HASH TABLES APPLIED IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONSISTENT\nHASHING ALGORITHMS?","answer":"Distributed systems benefit from concepts like hash tables and consistent\nhashing to manage a network of nodes efficiently.
