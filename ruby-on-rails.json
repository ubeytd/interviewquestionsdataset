[{"text":"1.\n\n\nWHAT IS RUBY ON RAILS, AND WHY IS IT POPULAR FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT?","answer":"Ruby on Rails, often termed simply as Rails, is a popular web application\nframework known for its simplicity and productivity.\n\nIt is built on the Ruby programming language and adheres to the MVC\n(Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. Rails takes a strong stance on\nconventions over configurations, reducing the need for boilerplate code.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Active Record: Simplifies data handling from databases, treating tables as\n   classes and rows as objects.\n * Action View: Manages user interface elements like forms and templates.\n * Action Controller: Handles requests, processes data, and manages flow between\n   models and views.\n\nRails also comes with an integrated testing suite and a robust security system.\n\n\nNOTABLE ADVANTAGES\n\n * Developer-Friendly Syntax: Ruby on Rails prioritizes readability, allowing\n   easy collaboration across teams.\n * Unmatched Ecosystem: The open-source community continually provides modules,\n   referred to as gems, for rapid feature integration.\n * Enhanced Productivity: The framework's emphasis on best practices automates\n   various tasks, reducing development time.\n * Scalability: While initially receiving criticism in this area, the framework\n   has evolved to handle large-scale applications effectively.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: RUBY ON RAILS CORE COMPONENTS\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# ActiveRecord model\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\n  has_many :posts\nend\n\n# Controller\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n  def show\n    @user = User.find(params[:id])\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nMORE ABOUT ITS PHILOSOPHY\n\nRails' philosophy, in a nutshell, can be described with the term Optimistic\nAssumptions. This means, the default setup works well for most cases, but\ndevelopers can override these assumptions when necessary.\n\nThis design philosophy alongside a strong focus on developer happiness is why\nRuby on Rails has been one of the leading web frameworks for almost two decades.","index":0,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE MVC ARCHITECTURE IN RAILS.","answer":"Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern embraced by Ruby on Rails. It\norganizes code into three interconnected components to improve maintainability,\nseparation of concerns, and ease of modification.\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF MVC\n\n * Model: Manages the application's data, logic, and rules. It directly\n   interacts with the database. In Rails, models are typically their own Ruby\n   class.\n * View: Handles the displaying of data to the user. In Rails, views are often\n   characterized by ERB templates, which combine HTML with embedded Ruby for\n   dynamic content.\n * Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, interpreting\n   data to provide the necessary visualization. It responds to user input and\n   performs tasks following the instructions defined in the model. Each public\n   method in a Rails controller corresponds to an action that can be invoked by\n   an incoming HTTP request.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC MVC RELATIONSHIP\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Controller\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController\n  def index\n    @articles = Article.all\n  end\nend\n\n# Model\nclass Article < ApplicationRecord\nend\n\n# View (ERB)\n<% @articles.each do |article| %>\n  <li><%= article.title %></li>\n<% end %>\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * The Article model represents a table in the database and is defined by\n   inheriting from ApplicationRecord.\n\n * The ArticlesController has a single action, index, which retrieves all\n   articles using the Article model and makes them available to the associated\n   view.\n\n * The View iterates through the list of articles, displaying their titles.\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MVC COMPONENTS\n\nMODEL\n\n * Represents the structure and behavior of the application, independent of the\n   user interface. ()\n * Performs various tasks like data validation, relationships, and business\n   logic. For instance, it ensures that a 'User' object should have a unique\n   email id.\n\nVIEW\n\n * Displays information to the user, with a layout and style. It might contain\n   conditional logic or loops but should remain free of data retrieval and\n   complex data manipulation..\n\nCONTROLLER\n\n * Coordinates the flow of data between the model and view. It receives input\n   from the users (HTTP requests) and directs that input to the model or view as\n   needed. ()\n   \n   For example, when a user initiates a new article creation in the web app, the\n   new action (a public method in the controller) will present a form (via the\n   view) to the user. Any data input from the form post will be handled by the\n   create action, which passes the data to the model for storage.","index":1,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT ARE GEMS AND HOW DO YOU USE THEM IN A RAILS PROJECT?","answer":"Gems are pre-built, reusable packages in Ruby on Rails, serving similar purposes\nas libraries do in other languages. They streamline common software development\ntasks and add functionality to your application. RubyGems, the package manager\nfor Ruby, is responsible for managing these gems.\n\n * Install Gems: Use the gem command-line tool to install a gem into your\n   system, making it globally accessible:\n   \n   gem install specific_gem\n   \n\n * Require Gems: When a gem is installed, you need to require it in your code.\n   However, when using Rails, many gems are automatically loaded, removing the\n   need for an explicit require statement:\n   \n   require 'specific_gem'\n   \n\n * Filter Gems: You can specify the versions of gems to use within your\n   application by including them in the Gemfile. Upon doing so, the bundle tool\n   installs gems that match the defined criteria:\n   \n   # In Gemfile\n   gem 'specific_gem', '~> 3.0.1'\n   \n\n * Load Gems: After defining the gems in the Gemfile, execute the bundle command\n   to load the dependencies:\n   \n   bundle install\n   \n   \n   Then use the Bundler.require directive in your application:\n   \n   # In config/application.rb. This line is generally already present.\n   Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)\n   \n\nThis process minimizes version conflicts and ensures a consistent development\nenvironment across different machines.\n\n\nADVANCED GEM MANAGEMENT\n\n 1. Development Mode: Rather than installing the entire set of gems for an\n    application, the group declaration in the Gemfile lets you segregate them\n    for specific environments.\n    \n    Choose from predefined groups like :development or :test:\n    \n    # In Gemfile\n    group :development, :test do\n      gem 'specific_gem', require: false\n    end\n    \n    \n    Then, install gems without these groups in the development or production\n    environment:\n    \n    bundle install --without development test\n    \n    \n    Gems enclosed in the development block won't be accessible in the production\n    environment.\n\n 2. Single Responsibility: Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle with\n    packaging gems that tackle a specific concern, offering focused\n    functionality.\n\n 3. Gem Naming Conventions: Comprehensible gem names make them more discoverable\n    and easier to understand.\n\n 4. Exposing Functionality: Reveal gem features through a straightforward API\n    and comprehensive documentation.\n\n 5. Avoiding Duplication: Determine if a gem introduces functionality that's\n    already available in another installed gem, to prevent redundancy.","index":2,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE GEMFILE IN A RAILS APPLICATION?","answer":"The Gemfile in a Ruby on Rails application acts as a manifest of all required\ngems for the project.\n\nIt serves as the foundation for the Bundler tool, which automates the process of\nmanaging and versioning gem dependencies.\n\n\nBUNDLER: GEM MANAGEMENT AND VERSION CONTROL\n\nBundler tracks gem versions to ensure project consistency across different\nenvironments and team members. It also keeps a record of specific gem versions\nin the project's Gemfile.lock.\n\nMECHANISM OF GEMFILE.LOCK\n\nWhen Bundler installs or updates gems, it incorporates them into the project\nwith precision according to the versions recorded in Gemfile.lock.\n\nThis feature is particularly beneficial for collaboration, as it preserves a\nconsistent gem \"snapshot\" for all contributors.\n\nGEMS GROUPING\n\nThe Gemfile segments gems into groups, each accommodating specific needs. For\ninstance, the :development group hosts gems necessary during the development\nphase.\n\ngroup :development, :test do\n  gem 'rspec-rails'\n  gem 'pry'\nend\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Ease of Setup: New project collaborators can swiftly onboard by leveraging\n   the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.\n * Version Consistency: Bundler enforces uniformity in gem versions, minimizing\n   potential compatibility issues.\n * Optimized Deployment: Bundler ensures that only required gem versions are\n   transferred in production environments.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Regular Updates: Periodically update gems to access new features,\n   improvements, and security patches while checking for compatibility with\n   updated versions.\n * Shared Understanding: Collaborators should be familiar with the gems enlisted\n   in the Gemfile.","index":3,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU INSTALL A RUBY GEM?","answer":"To install a Ruby gem, start by using either of the following:\n\n * Directly from RubyGems.org: $ gem install gem_name\n * From a local file: $ gem install /path/to/gem.gem\n\nTo select a specific version, add the --version flag, and for developer tools,\nuse the --dev or --development flags.\n\nFor development or testing, it's best to install gems in your project's\ndirectory, a process known as bundling.\n\n\nCOMMON BUNDLER COMMANDS\n\nBUNDLE INSTALL\n\nThe bundle install command installs all gem dependencies in the local project,\nas specified in the Gemfile.\n\nBUNDLE UPDATE\n\nRunning bundle update gem_name updates the specified gem to its latest version.\nTo update all gems, omit the gem name.\n\n\nUSING GEMFILE AND GEMFILE.LOCK\n\n * Gemfile: This file lists all the gems your project depends on and any rules\n   for their usage.\n * Gemfile.lock: This companion file records the specific gems and versions that\n   are currently in use.\n\nAlways check both files into version control. This practice ensures a consistent\ndevelopment and production environment for your team.\n\n\nSTEPS TO BUNDLE GEMS\n\nINITIALIZE A GEMFILE\n\nIf your project doesn't have a Gemfile yet, run bundle init in its directory to\ncreate one.\n\nADD GEMS\n\nIn the Gemfile, list all your project's gem dependencies and any version or\nsource restrictions.\n\nFor example:\n\n# Gemfile\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\n\ngem 'rails', '~> 6.0'\ngem 'sqlite3'\n\n\nINSTALL DEPENDENCIES\n\nFinally, to install the defined gem set from the Gemfile into the local\ndirectory, run bundle install.

For instance, if you\n   expect an integer, non-integer strings would be rejected.\n\n\nCOMMON PATTERNS\n\nPARAMETER-DRIVEN LOGIC\n\nIn some cases, actions are required based on specific parameters. While it can\nbe more favorable to approach this through RESTful routes and action methods,\nthere might be cases where a single action has varied responsibilities based on\ninput.\n\nHowever, it's advisable to use such patterns sparingly, favoring clear and\npredictable semantics that are easier to maintain.\n\nDIRECT PARAMETER MANIPULATION\n\nDirect params hash manipulation presents challenges and isn't recommended in\nmost scenarios due to:\n\n * Security Vulnerabilities: Manual sanitation can overlook potential threats.\n * Code Maintainability: If the app grows, it becomes increasingly challenging\n   to track and manage direct hash manipulations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ACCEPTING USER INPUT AS PARAMETERS\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nclass UsersController():\n    # Adding or updating user via RESTful methods.\n    \n    def create(self, request):\n        # Example URL: /users\n        new_user = User.create(user_params(request))\n        return HttpResponse(f\"User {new_user.name} created successfully.\")\n    \n    def update(self, request, user_id):\n        # Example URL: /users/123\n        user = User.find(user_id)\n        user.update(user_params(request))\n        return HttpResponse(f\"User {user.name} updated successfully.\")\n    \n    # Additional action to suspend a user based on parameters.\n    def suspend(self, request):\n        # Example URL: /users/suspend\n        user = User.find_by(email: params['email'])\n        user.suspend\n        return HttpResponse(f\"User {user.email} suspended successfully.\")\n\n    def user_params(self, request):\n        return {\n            'name': request['name'],  # example: from a form or JSON payload\n            'email': request['email'],  # More fields can be added\n        }\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Utilize RESTful Routing: Whenever possible, let routing and clear naming suit\n   the action types. This simplifies your codebase and makes it more predictable\n   for others.\n * Leverage Form Objects and Service Objects: For complicated or non-standard\n   operations, consider using form or service objects to encapsulate your logic\n   and keep your controllers slim.\n * Follow Conventions: Unless you have compelling reasons to do otherwise,\n   sticking to the conventions of Rails leads to a more maintainable and\n   cohesive codebase.","index":13,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nWHAT FILTERS ARE AVAILABLE IN RAILS CONTROLLERS AND HOW DO YOU USE THEM?","answer":"Filter methods in Ruby on Rails provide a powerful means to run code either\nbefore or after specific controller actions, or as a \"catch-all\" for multiple\nactions.\n\n\nPREFILTERS\n\nPrefilters, which include before_action, prepend_before_action, define methods\nthat execute before the associated action(s).\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING BEFORE_ACTION\n\nclass OrdersController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :authenticate_user!\n  \n  def show\n    @order = Order.find(params[:id])\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn this example, the authenticate_user! method is run before\nOrdersController#show.\n\n\nPOSTFILTERS\n\nPostfilters, including after_action and prepend_after_action, run methods after\nthe respective action is executed.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING AFTER_ACTION\n\nclass InvoicesController < ApplicationController\n  after_action :log_invoice_creation\n\n  def create\n    @invoice = Invoice.create(invoice_params)\n    redirect_to @invoice\n  end\nend\n\n\nHere, log_invoice_creation is invoked after the InvoicesController#create\naction.\n\n\nAROUND FILTERS\n\nAround filters, defined using the around_action method, encapsulate the\nassociated action, providing a mechanism for code to run both before and after.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING AROUND_ACTION\n\nclass PaymentsController < ApplicationController\n  around_action :log_payment_process\n\n  def process\n    # Payment processing logic\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe log_payment_process method would wrap around PaymentsController#process,\nenabling both pre- and post-action code execution.\n\n\nFUNCTIONAL USE-CASES\n\n * Authorization and Authentication: Execute before actions to validate user\n   credentials.\n * Parameter Processing: Use as a \"catch-all\" for standardizing input data.\n * Caching: Employ after actions to cache certain results, optimizing\n   performance.\n * Log Maintenance: Run methods before and after actions for detailed logging.\n\n\nAPPLICATION\n\nBy integrating filters within the Rails controllers, one can ensure a\ncentralized, systematic workflow across actions, fortifying the consistency and\nefficiency of the application.\n\nUsing ActionController::Live live streaming is possible.\nCollects browser connection specific data, capturing segments of the activities.\nAn application is initially identified by its controller and action, both of\nwhich can be customized. For instance, a PostsController typically has actions\nfor creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts. Each of these actions\ncomprises a series of steps aimed at handling the request, including interaction\nwith the model and view layers.\n\n\nMETHOD DESCRIPTIONS\n\nPARAMETERS REQUIRING AUTHENTICATION\n\n * current_user: Resolves the current user object, often used for user-specific\n   operations.\n * authenticate_user!: Checks for user authentication and halts the chain if\n   authentication fails.\n * user_signed_in?: Provides a boolean indicative of user presence.\n\nPUBLIC METHODS\n\n * public: Marks an action as available publicly without requiring any\n   pre-action steps.\n * External Redirects: redirect_to or redirect_back can guide request flow\n   externally.\n\nRESPONSE HANDLING\n\n * respond_to: Determines response format based on the associated MIME type.\n   Helps when handling different content types like HTML, XML, or JSON. Handles\n   AJAX requests more gracefully.\n * head: Sends an empty header-contained response, often used as a status\n   verifier.\n\nABOUT SESSIONS\n\n * reset_session: Wipes the session clean, helping to terminate user's session\n   expressly. Can be useful when implementing logout functionalities.\n\nREDIRECTS\n\n * redirect_to: Transfers request to a different URL, typically another action.\n   Example: redirect_to dashboard_url, alert: \"Operation failed!\"\n * redirect_back: Directs to the previous location known to the application,\n   useful for things like cancellations or dynamically tracked pages like error\n   pages or search results.\n\n\nACTION DEFAULTS\n\nBy default, an action is set up to respond to an HTTP GET request. This renders\nan HTML view generated by the details obtained via the action. Standard naming\npractices and RESTful routing lead to predictable action and view associations.\n\nCOMMON ACTION NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\n * New Record Creation: Present a form for resource creation. Method: GET.\n   Action: new.\n * Record Creation: Complete the process of creating a new resource using data\n   from params. Method: POST. Action: create.\n * Record Viewing: Render the view of a previously created record. Method: GET.\n   Action: show.\n * Record Editing: Present a form for updating an existing resource, often\n   pre-populated with the current data. Method: GET. Action: edit.\n * Record Update: Complete the process of modifying an existing record using\n   data from params. Method: PATCH or PUT. Action: update.\n * Record Deletion: Remove an existing resource. Method: DELETE. Action:\n   destroy.\n\nThese mapping conventions between standard controller actions and RESTful CRUD\noperations not only are insightful for any developer following these\nconventions, but also they enable a standardized and intuitive use of resources.\n\n\nRAKE TASKS : MAKING USE OF IT\n\n'Rake' tasks, such as those used for database setup or clean-up tasks, can be\nfused directly into controller actions, providing a mechanism to manage or\nobserve these tasks through URL requests. This strategy aligns well when\nensuring a controlled setting for such tasks.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: INTEGRATION OF RAKE TASK WITHIN A CONTROLLER ACTION\n\nclass DatabaseTasksController < ApplicationController\n  def reset\n    ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.reset_database\n    redirect_to root_path, notice: 'Database reset complete.'\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn this example, navigating to localhost:3000/database_tasks/reset triggers the\nreset action.","index":14,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"16.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT REDIRECTS IN A RAILS CONTROLLER?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, redirects are key to both user navigation and maintaining\nRESTful routes within your web application. You have multiple flexibility\noptions for incorporating them.\n\n\nREDIRECT MECHANISMS\n\nREDIRECT_TO ACTION\n\nThe redirect_to Rails controller method is ideal for HTTP status codes other\nthan 200 OK, like redirects after form submissions.\n\nHere's an example using create to handle a form submission:\n\ndef create\n  @post = Post.new(post_params)\n\n  if @post.save\n    redirect_to @post, notice: 'Post was successfully created.'\n  else\n    render :new\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn this case, a successful save action will redirect to a created post, while a\nfailed save action will just re-render the new view.\n\nREDIRECT_BACK HELPER\n\nThe redirect_back method is beneficial in situations where the previous location\nis desirable. For example, using it with an authentication action to reroute a\nuser to wherever they were before needing to log in.\n\ndef authenticate\n  return if current_user\n\n  flash[:alert] = 'Please log in to continue'\n  redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)\nend\n\n\nIn this instance, if a user attempts to perform an action requiring\nauthentication, they'll be directed to the login interface. Upon logging in,\nredirect_back will navigate them to their intended destination.\n\n\nRESTFUL REDIRECTS\n\nIf you require a hierarchy based on RESTful routing, you have several options at\nyour disposal, such as using associated resources and nested routes.\n\nASSOCIATED RESOURCES\n\nSometimes, entities in your system maintain associations. In these cases, you\nmight want to capture the parent record and redirect to it, post an operation on\nthe child.\n\nHere's an example using a tasks_controller with an associated project.\n\nclass TasksController < ApplicationController\n  #...\n  def create\n    @project = Project.find(params[:project_id])\n    @task = @project.tasks.build(task_params)\n\n    if @task.save\n      redirect_to @project, notice: 'Task was successfully created'\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n  end\n  #...\nend\n\n\nThe create method here is building a new task that's associated with a\nparticular project. A successful save action on the task will trigger a redirect\nto the parent project.\n\nPOLYMORPHIC REDIRECTS\n\nIn scenarios where an action is applicable to multiple models, polymorphic\nredirects offer a suitable solution.\n\nFor illustration, consider a generic CommentsController responsible for managing\ncomments, which could belong to either a Post or an Article. When a comment is\ncreated or deleted, a successful operation should redirect the user to either\nthe related post or article.\n\nThe controller would look like this:\n\nclass CommentsController < ApplicationController\n  # ...\n  def create\n    @commentable = find_commentable\n    @comment = @commentable.comments.build(comment_params)\n\n    if @comment.save\n      redirect_to @commentable, notice: 'Comment was successfully added.'\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def find_commentable\n    return Post.find(params[:post_id]) if params[:post_id]\n    return Article.find(params[:article_id]) if params[:article_id]\n  end\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nIn the create method, the @commentable object is resolved through the\nfind_commentable method, which in turn is determined based on the presence of\npost_id or article_id in the parameters. The successful save action on a comment\nwill direct the user back to the appropriate content entity based on which it's\nassociated with.\n\n\nROOT-ROUTED REDIRECTS\n\nIf you want a certain controller action to route to the application's root path,\nyou can specify this through the use of :root within your config/routes.rb.\n\nFor example, the following declaration within config/routes.rb makes the root\npath of the application direct the user to the static_pages#home action:\n\nRails.application.routes.draw do\n  root 'static_pages#home'\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nWhen a user visits the root path of the application, it will trigger a redirect,\nushering them to the home action of StaticPagesController as configured.","index":15,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"17.\n\n\nWHAT IS A STRONG PARAMETER, AND WHY SHOULD YOU USE IT?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, strong parameters ensure that only permissible attributes are\naccepted from web forms.

Member Routes: Ideal for actions directly linked to a specific resource.\n    They carry the resource's identifier in the URL, like /users/1/profile,\n    where profile is a member action of UsersController.\n\n 2. Collection Routes: Instead of focusing on one item, collection routes target\n    a broader set of resources. An example would be /blog/posts/archive, where\n    archive is a collection action of PostsController for archiving multiple\n    posts at once.\n\nHTTP VERB ASSOCIATION\n\n * Member Routes often tie to GET and POST due to their resource-specific\n   nature. For instance, a user profile page might expect a GET request.\n\n * Collection Routes frequently link to GET and POST as well but could include\n   other methods. For example, the archive collection action in the blog posts\n   context could be triggered via a GET request.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION IN CONFIG/ROUTES.RB\n\nYou can specify these specialized routes using resources in your routes file:\n\nresources :users do\n  # Member routes\n  get 'profile', on: :member\n  # Collection routes\n  get 'archived', on: :collection\nend\n\n\nCONTROLLER RELEVANCE\n\n 1. Member Routes: Associate with actions specific to certain resources. Within\n    the controller, they would typically occur after retrieving a single\n    resource.\n\n 2. Collection Routes: Designed for actions involving sets of resources, and in\n    the controller, they are often executed before a resource instance is\n    fetched.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere's how the routes would be defined in the config/routes.rb file:\n\nresources :users do\n  get 'profile', on: :member\n  get 'archived', on: :collection\nend\n\n\nIn the corresponding UsersController, you would find methods associated with\nthese actions:\n\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n   # For member route\n  def profile\n    @user = User.find(params[:id])\n    # Additional logic for displaying user's profile\n  end\n\n  # For collection route\n  def archived\n    @archived_posts = User.find(params[:id]).archived_posts\n    # Additional logic for displaying archived posts\n  end\nend\n\n\nFinally, the views would reflect these actions:\n\n * For the member route, you might have a users/profile.html.erb file to display\n   the user's profile.\n * For the collection route, a users/archived.html.erb could render a list of\n   archived posts.","index":17,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"19.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE SESSION DATA IN RAILS?","answer":"Session data in a Rails application is a powerful way to handle user-specific\ninformation across multiple requests, typically used for authentication, user\nshopping carts, or other personalized experiences without URL parameters or POST\ndata.\n\nHere are the details and best practices:\n\n\nSESSION STORAGE MECHANISMS\n\n * Client Side (Cookies): Data is stored directly in the client's browser. Make\n   sure to encrypt and sign sensitive data. This approach is simpler, but the\n   data size is typically limited to 4KB per cookie, and it's less secure for\n   sensitive information.\n\n * Server Side: Data is stored on the server, identified by a session ID sent to\n   the client. This approach doesn't expose data to the client and isn't limited\n   by cookie size, making it more secure and suitable for larger datasets.\n\n\nRAILS CONFIGURATION\n\nThe appropriate settings are defined in the config/initializers/session_store.rb\nfile.\n\n * Database: With Rails session storage, you can configure session tracking in a\n   separate database table, enabling the use of advanced databases for sessions.\n\n * Files: If you prefer file storage for sessions, Rails offers this option for\n   flexibility. The tmp/sessions/ directory will store the session files.\n\n * Cookie Store: By default, Rails employs encrypted and signed cookies.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR DATA STORAGE\n\n * Sensitive Data: Steer clear of placing highly sensitive information in the\n   session.\n\n * Expiry: Set explicit expiry timeframes for session data to ensure it doesn't\n   persist indefinitely.\n\n * Minimalism: Only store necessary data in the session to optimize performance\n   and security.\n\n\nSESSION MANAGEMENT\n\n * Persistence: The session starts when a user logs in and ends either on\n   explicit logout or after a defined period of inactivity.\n\n * Control: Developers can manually start, persist, or clear the session.\n\n\nSECURITY MEASURES\n\n * Token Management: Employ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens to avert\n   unauthorized requests from the session data.\n\n * Signatures: Utilize data signatures to foil session tampering.\n\n * Encryption: Keep the session data encrypted to prevent potential\n   eavesdropping.\n\n\nADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Flash: Dispatch short-lived messages to users using the \"flash\" feature,\n   especially after operations like form submissions.\n\n * External Solutions: For more extensive applications or use cases, consider\n   offloading sessions to dedicated services or using external storage solutions\n   for flexibility and performance.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SETTING AND RETRIEVING SESSION DATA\n\nHere is the Rails code:\n\n# Setting session data\nsession[:user_id] = user.id\n\n# Retrieving session data\nif session[:user_id]\n  @user = User.find(session[:user_id])\nend\n","index":18,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"20.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE FLASH IN RAILS, AND HOW DO YOU USE IT?","answer":"The Flash in Ruby on Rails is a powerful mechanism for persisting a message or\nan object temporarily across HTTP requests.

Model Initialization and Connection: When a class inherits from\n     ActiveRecord::Base, it establishes a connection to the configured database\n     and sets up various class and instance methods for database interactions.\n\n 2.  Virtual Attributes: Some model properties need to be calculated based on\n     others or external information. These virtual attributes exist only in\n     memory and aren't persisted to the database.\n\n 3.  Object-Persistence Identity: Each model instance is associated with a\n     unique database row. When you create a new instance or fetch an existing\n     one, its attributes reflect the corresponding database entry.\n\n 4.  Database Integrity Mechanisms: With validations and transactions, Active\n     Record ensures that any data changes are appropriate and consistent, even\n     when multiple instances are being modified simultaneously.\n\n 5.  Querying: Active Record provides an intuitive interface for constructing\n     database queries using methods like find, where, and more.\n\n 6.  Associations: Models can be connected, facilitating rich data\n     representations and simple, intuitive operations like fetching a user's\n     associated posts.\n\n 7.  Life Cycle Hooks: Define methods triggered at specific life cycle points,\n     for example, a before_save hook that encrypts a user's password before\n     storing it.\n\n 8.  Migrations Integration: Active Record aligns a model's structure with the\n     database schema, making use of Rails migrations for smooth alterations and\n     versioning.\n\n 9.  Thread Safety: While Active Record didn't initially support concurrency,\n     recent versions have shown improvements. Models are inherently specific to\n     threads, albeit read replicas might still lag behind write actions.\n\n 10. Performance Considerations: With the introduction of Relation objects,\n     Active Record simplifies the execution of complex queries by embracing a\n     lazy, optimized evaluation strategy.

Each\n   migration file corresponds to a discrete change, promoting database\n   consistency.\n\n * Order and Rollback: Migrations scripts are sequenced based on the file\n   timestamp, ensuring that changes are executed in the correct order. Should\n   issues arise, the framework provides a mechanism to undo changes\n   (db:rollback).\n\n * Annotation and Comments: Developers can append comments to migrations,\n   offering context and traceability for schema modifications.\n\n * Migration Statuses: Rails keeps track of migration completion per\n   environment, facilitating differential updates. New migrations are executed,\n   while existing ones are bypassed.\n\n * Single Commit for Multiple Changes: ActiveRecord makes it possible to wrap\n   several schema changes into a single migration script, assuring that all\n   alterations either succeed or fail as a cohesive unit.\n\n * Code-Driven Database Adjustments: Migrations empower developers to define\n   schema adjustments using Ruby code, promoting consistency, and eliminating\n   the need to handwrite raw SQL.\n\n * Data Transformation: Beyond structural updates, migrations can include data\n   manipulations, as well as additional tasks, ensuring comprehensive database\n   adjustments.\n\n * Uptime During Changes: Running migrations might momentarily impact the\n   application's availability, particularly during substantial updates. Proper\n   planning, as well as using strategies such as rolling updates, can mitigate\n   these interruptions.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Version Consistency: Migrations should be part of the versioning system to\n   maintain alignment between code and the related database schema.\n\n * Shared Development Database: In multi-developer setups, the sharing of a\n   common, regularly updated development database helps ensure compatibility of\n   migration scripts.\n\n * Supplementary Data Changes: Complex data changes are better managed through\n   supplemental tools like Rake tasks or Active Record methods within\n   migrations, reducing the risk of errors.\n\n * Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Automation: Employ CI/CD\n   pipelines to automate migration execution, promoting swift and consistent\n   updates across deployment environments.\n\n\nSHORTCOMINGS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES\n\n * Collaborative Challenges: In team settings, collisions may happen when\n   multiple team members concurrently develop and run migrations. Employ clear\n   communication strategies and code versioning systems to navigate these\n   challenges.\n\n * Complex Data Transformations: Performing intricate data adjustments within\n   migrations can be error-prone. It's often more prudent to delegate these\n   tasks to specialized tools or professionals.\n\n * Persistence During Failures: While mechanisms for rollback exist, restoring\n   the database to its precise original state upon a failed migration is often\n   intricate. Teams should be prepared to troubleshoot such scenarios\n   effectively.\n\n\nCOMMON COMMANDS AND THEIR ACTIONS\n\n * rake db:migrate - Executes the pending migrations to update the database\n   schema.\n * rake db:rollback - Reverts the most recent migration.\n * rake db:version - Displays the current schema version and any pending\n   migrations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STANDARD MIGRATION\n\nHere is the Migration file:\n\n# Filename: 20220101000000_create_users_table.rb\nclass CreateUsersTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]\n  def change\n    create_table :users do |t|\n      t.string :name\n      t.string :email\n      t.timestamps\n    end\n  end\nend\n","index":22,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"24.\n\n\nWHAT ARE VALIDATIONS IN A RAILS MODEL, AND WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, validations ensure the data integrity of models before they\nare saved to the database. This mechanism helps you catch and rectify data\ninconsistencies. Rails offers a range of built-in validation rules while also\nsupporting custom validations.\n\n\nKEY VALIDATION ASPECTS\n\n 1. When They Occur: Validations are triggered during model-provided actions,\n    typically right before an object is saved.\n\n 2. Validation States: Each attribute has a state: empty (not assigned a value\n    yet), valid (meets all validation conditions), or invalid (fails at least\n    one validation helper).\n\n 3. Error Recording: During validation failures, error messages are logged for\n    the attributes that didn't pass. These messages are displayed to users and\n    can also be used for programmatic checks.\n\n 4. Model-Level vs. Attribute-Level: Validations can target either an individual\n    attribute or the model as a whole.\n\n 5. Preserving Data: A failed validation will prevent data from being saved to\n    the database. Once the issues are resolved, a new save attempt can be made.\n\n 6. Custom Validations: You can implement your unique validation rules using\n    methods within your model. To identify failed validations in custom methods,\n    use errors.add.\n\n\nCOMMON VALIDATION EXAMPLES\n\nHere are some instances of built-in validation rules:\n\nPRESENCE: ENSURES A FIELD ISN'T EMPTY\n\nvalidates :title, presence: true\n\n\nUNIQUENESS: GUARANTEES FIELD IS UNIQUE IN DATABASE\n\nvalidates :username, uniqueness: true\n\n\nLENGTH: SPECIFIES STRING LENGTH\n\nvalidates :bio, length: { minimum: 10, maximum: 1000 }\n\n\nNUMERICALITY: CHECKS IF VALUE IS A NUMBER\n\nvalidates :age, numericality: { only_integer: true }\n\n\nINCLUSION: VALIDATES THAT A VALUE IS INCLUDED IN A GIVEN SET\n\nvalidates :gender, inclusion: { in: ['male', 'female', 'other'] }\n\n\nEXCLUSION: ENSURES A VALUE ISN'T INCLUDED IN A GIVEN SET\n\nvalidates :password, exclusion: { in: %w[123456 654321] }\n\n\n\nHANDLING VALIDATION ERRORS\n\nIt's vital to inform users about validation errors. In views, you can define\nerror messages using:\n\n<%= form_for @user do |f| %>\n  <% if @user.errors.any? %>\n    <div id=\"error_explanation\">\n      <h2><%= pluralize(@user.errors.count, \"error\") %> prohibited this user from being saved:</h2>\n      <ul>\n      <% @user.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>\n        <li><%= message %></li>\n      <% end %>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  <% end %>  \n<% end %>\n\n\n\nCODE REVIEW: USER MODEL\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\n  has_secure_password\n\n  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true\n  validates :password, length: { minimum: 6 }\n  validates :role, inclusion: { in: %w[admin user] }\n  validate :adult_age_check\n\n  private\n\n  def adult_age_check\n    if !age.nil? && age < 18\n      errors.add(:age, \"must be at least 18\")\n    end\n  end\nend\n","index":23,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"25.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU ESTABLISH ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN RAILS MODELS (E.G., HAS_MANY,\nBELONGS_TO)?","answer":"Rails simplifies the creation of relationships between models using predefined\nmethods, known as associations.\n\n\nTYPES OF ASSOCIATIONS IN RAILS\n\nONE-TO-ONE\n\n * One-to-One: e.g., a User has_one Profile\n\nONE-TO-MANY\n\n * One-to-Many: e.g., a User has_many Items\n * Many-to-One (the reverse of One-to-Many): e.g., an Item belongs_to a User\n\nMANY-TO-MANY\n\n * Many-to-Many: e.g., Student has_many :courses, through: :enrollments\n\n\nESTABLISHING ASSOCIATIONS\n\nIn Ruby on Rails, associations are set up by declaring specific methods in the\nmodel classes:\n\n1.

If we\naim to retrieve all posts along with their respective user's name, the\ninefficient N+1 approach executes one query to fetch all the posts, followed by\na separate query for each user (resulting in N queries).\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: EAGER LOADING\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Before Eager Loading\nPost.all.each { |post| puts post.user.name }\n# After Eager Loading\nPost.includes(:user).each { |post| puts post.user.name }\n\n\nIn the first scenario, Post.all issues a general query, and post.user triggers\nsingle-user queries. By contrast, Post.includes(:user).each performs a joint\nquery from the beginning.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION: EAGER LOADING\n\nHere is a Ruby code:\n\n# Before Eager Loading\n# This will fire N+1 queries (one for each unique `user_id` on posts table)\nPost.all.each { |post| puts post.user.name }\n\n# After Eager Loading\n  # This will fire only 1 query, to load all the posts and their associated users\nPost.includes(:user).each { |post| puts post.user.name }\n\n\nUseful for:\n\n * One-to-Many Associations, as in the example of posts belonging to users.\n * Slowing queries in need of associated records.\n * Merging conditions and orders, improving query tuning.\n\nFavor includes over joins:\n\n * joins connects tables directly.\n * includes gels better, often with multiple tables and associations.\n\nAlways profile:\nBefore and after changes to the database, profile using performance tools like\nBullet or QueryTrackers.","index":27,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"29.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MANAGE DATABASE TRANSACTIONS IN RAILS?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord provides a robust, integrated workflow for\nmanaging database transactions.\n\n\nMETHODS FOR TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT\n\n * transaction : Encapsulates a block of code and executes it within a single\n   transaction.

It employs several strategies, such as compression\nand caching, to boost performance.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\nThe Asset Pipeline consists of three core elements:\n\n 1. CSS and JavaScript preprocessors: Inbuilt support for SCSS, Sass, and\n    CoffeeScript provides improved development workflows and minifies resources\n    for deployment.\n\n 2. Sprockets: Manages asset organization and automates various optimizations.\n    It recognizes dependencies and combines relevant resources.\n\n 3. Link Helpers: Enable streamlined asset links in views. They aid with\n    versioning and direct browsers to cache assets effectively.\n\n\nASSET DIRECTORIES\n\nIn a typical Rails application:\n\n * app/assets: Assets unique to this app, not shared across engines or external\n   libraries.\n\n * lib/assets: Code resources that are generic to the app or might be used in\n   multiple apps. They are accessible from other engines or gems.\n\n * vendor/assets: Resources sourced from third-party vendors. Usually, it's not\n   advisable to modify these files.\n\n * public/assets: Compiled assets for deployment. Best practice is to let\n   Sprockets manage this directory, rather than altering it manually.\n\n\nASSET MANIFESTS\n\nAsset manifests, defined through application.css or application.js, are the\nstarting points for asset organization and inclusion.\n\nUse //= require directives within these manifests to explicitly list all assets\nor groups of assets to load.\n\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLES\n\nHere are some example application.js and application.scss files to better\nillustrate the concepts:\n\nAPPLICATION.JS\n\n//= require jquery\n//= require moment\n//= require_tree ./utils\n//= require_self\n//= require main\n\n\nUnder the folder app/assets/javascripts/utils, there might be multiple .js files\n– each will be automatically included. require_self includes the manifest file\nitself, which is often essential.\n\nAPPLICATION.SCSS\n\n@import 'base_variables';\n@import 'settings/scaffolding';\n@import 'shared/forms';\n@import 'modules/user_profile';\n@import 'specific_styles', 'print';\n\n\nThe list of imported SCSS files indicates a modularized approach, with their\nrespective usages.\n\n\nCACHING OF ASSETS\n\nFingerprinting assets generates unique identifiers based on their content. These\nidentifiers help in cache management.\n\nTo facilitate this, incorporate the asset_path or asset_url helper methods in\nyour views and CSS/SCSS files.\n\n * For Views:\n   \n   For instance, in a .html.erb file:\n   \n   <img src=\"<%= asset_path('logo.png') %>\" alt=\"Company Logo\">\n   \n\n * For Stylesheets:\n   \n   In a SCSS file, use:\n   \n   background: url(asset_url('background.jpg'));\n   \n\nEnsure that the HTTP headers for your assets permit long-term caching. This\nconfiguration can typically be done in web servers like Apache or Nginx.\n\n\nREVISITING THE BASICS\n\nIt's crucial to understand that modifying assets manually in the public/assets\ndirectory might lead to discrepancies with their precompile versions.\n\nRake tasks like rake assets:precompile standardize and streamline the asset\npipeline, ensuring reliable production deployments.

They are especially useful in separating\ncontent from its presentation and reducing redundancy. This further enables\nstraightforward changes that reflect across multiple pages.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n1. ERB DIRECTIVES\n\nVisual elements within views are enclosed within a set of brackets with a\npercent sign. For example, <%= yield %> signals where the view's main content is\ninserted.\n\n2. YIELD DIRECTIVE\n\nThe yield directive forms an interface between layouts and views. Wherever it's\nplaced in the layout, that's where specific view content will integrate.\n\n3. MULTIPLE YIELD SITES\n\nYou can have multiple yield sites, each corresponding to different view\ncomponents. Encapsulate the specific content in the view with designated\ncontent_for directives for seamless integration.\n\n4. CONTENT_FOR DIRECTIVE\n\ncontent_for designates regions in the view that should populate unique yield\npoints in the layout. This way, you can segment various parts of the view for\ndifferent parts of the layout.\n\n5. PARTIAL INVOCATIONS\n\nYour layout can include or invoke partials, streamlining the markup in the\nlayout file and promoting reusability.\n\n6. PREDEFINED LAYOUTS\n\nRails comes with default layout hierarchy, allowing a unified look and feel to\nbe extended across multiple views. By creating dedicated layouts for different\nprocesses, data types, or stakeholders, you can tailor the presentation to suit\nspecific contexts.\n\n7. HTML HEAD SECTION\n\nThe layout often includes the <head> section, encapsulating critical information\nsuch as the page title and meta tags.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LAYOUTS AND VIEWS IN PRACTICE\n\nHere is the example:\n\n\"LAYOUTS/APPLICATION.HTML.ERB\"\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title><%= yield :title %></title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header>\n      <%= render 'shared/header' %>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n      <% flash.each do |key, value| %>\n        <% if key == 'notice' %>\n          <p class=\"notice\"><%= value %></p>\n        <% elsif key == 'alert' %>\n          <p class=\"alert\"><%= value %></p>\n        <% end %>\n      <% end %>\n      <%= yield %>\n    </main>\n    <footer>\n      <%= render 'shared/footer' %>\n    </footer>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\n\"VIEWS/LAYOUTS/USERS/DASHBOARD.HTML.ERB\"\n\n<% content_for :title do %>\n  Dashboard\n<% end %>\n<h1>Welcome to your dashboard!</h1>\n<%= render 'users/sidebar' %>\n<%= render 'users/widget' %>\n","index":34,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"36.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT FORM VALIDATIONS ON THE CLIENT-SIDE USING RAILS?","answer":"In any Rails application, you can implement client-side form validations for\nincreased responsiveness and to alleviate server load.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION IN RAILS\n\n * Enhanced User Experience: Quick feedback without page reloads.\n * Reduced Server Load: Unnecessary server calls are avoided.\n * Increased Speed: User input is checked instantly.\n\n\nUSING UNOBTRUSIVE JAVASCRIPT\n\nRails achieves client-side validations through its Rails JavaScript Helpers,\nalso known as Unobtrusive JavaScript. This method ensures JavaScript\ninteractions do not interfere with existing HTML or CSS code.\n\nTo enable client-side validations, you would typically generate your form using\nthe form_with helper and define validation rules within your model.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MODEL WITH VALIDATIONS\n\nHere is a Ruby on Rails code:\n\n 1. Model (user.rb):\n\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\n  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true\n  validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6 }\nend\n\n\n 2. The Form View (new.html.erb):\n\n<%= form_with(model: @user, local: true) do |form| %>\n  <%= form.text_field :email %>\n  <%= form.password_field :password %>\n  <%= form.submit %>\n<% end %>\n\n\n 3. jQuery required:\n\n<script>\n  $('#new_user').validate();\n</script>\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL STRATEGIES FOR CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION\n\n * The Simple Form Gem: Simplifies form creation.\n * Using JavaScript Libraries: You can integrate other libraries, but some might\n   not be recognized as unobtrusive by default.","index":35,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"37.\n\n\nWHAT IS TURBOLINKS, AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT RAILS APPLICATIONS?","answer":"Turbolinks is a technology that boosts navigation and responsiveness in web\napplications. In the context of Ruby on Rails, it enhances the user experience\nwithout the need for traditional full page reloads.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Link Hijacking: Instead of following a link in the conventional manner,\n   requests are intercepted, and only the page changes are obtained from the\n   server.\n\n * History Management: Turbolinks keeps track of visited pages, allowing users\n   to navigate forward and backward using browser controls just as if they were\n   using an ordinary website.\n\n * Cache Management: Only new or modified assets are fetched on server trips,\n   minimizing data transfer.\n\n * Partial Content Updates: Views and assets that don't change across\n   navigations are cached and preserved, streamlining performance.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION NUANCES\n\n * Event Binding: Actions such as \"load\" and \"ready\" in JavaScript are not\n   triggered following a Turbolinks navigation. The \"turbolinks:load\" event\n   should be used instead.\n\n * Asset Management: Traditional methods like inline JavaScript and the\n   \"document ready\" event aren't optimal with Turbolinks and might interfere\n   with its functioning. Standard Rails asset pipeline techniques or UJS\n   (unobtrusive JavaScript) via link_to or form_with generally align better.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TURBOLINKS EVENT BINDING\n\nHere is the JavaScript:\n\ndocument.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', function() {\n  // Code to execute after each Turbolinks load\n});\n","index":36,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"38.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW WEBPACKER IS USED WITH RAILS.","answer":"Webpacker is an integrated Webpack setup in modern Rails applications. It\nmanages JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, providing a structured and efficient\nway to handle frontend code.\n\n\nCORE FEATURES\n\nMODERN JS FRAMEWORK SUPPORT\n\nWebpacker allows Rails applications to work with modern JavaScript frameworks\nlike React, Vue.js, and Angular, alongside plain JavaScript.\n\nASSET COMPILATION AND VERSIONING\n\nWebpacker streamlines the processing of assets such as JavaScript and CSS,\nimproving caching and reducing requests to the server.\n\nWebpacker natively supports ES6 and modern JavaScript features through Babel.\n\nCOHESIVE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT\n\nWhether in development or production, the development is smooth, with on-the-fly\nrecompilation and high-performance optimization.\n\n\nWEBPACKER INTEGRATION WITH RAILS\n\nWebpacker's seamless integration with Rails is evident in its management of the\napplication's asset pipeline.\n\nYAML CONFIGURATION\n\nWebpacker employs a single YAML configuration file, configuring everything from\nentry points to compilation settings.\n\nCONSOLIDATED PUBLIC DIRECTORY\n\nCompiled assets are stored in app/javascript and public/packs by default, neatly\nmeshing them with the asset pipeline.\n\nASSET HELPERS\n\nWebpacker offers a set of asset path helpers, such as javascript_pack_tag or\nstylesheet_pack_tag, ensuring correct associations between HTML files and\nWebpack bundles.\n\n\nUNDER THE HOOD\n\n * Yarn is used to manage node dependencies.\n * Webpacker adds Webpack for Rails through a gem.\n\n\nMERGING WEBPACKER & SPROCKETS\n\nThrough a well-orchestrated partnership, Webpacker coexists harmoniously with\nSprockets, the traditional Rails Asset Pipeline, providing the best of both\nworlds. While Sprockets perfectly handles legacy codebases and non-JS/CSS\nassets, Webpacker amends its powers for modern front-end development. Note that\nstarting with Rails 7, helpers such as javascript_pack_tag have been ported to\nSimple.js, and this will eventually phase out Webpacker from Rails.","index":37,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"39.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU INCLUDE JAVASCRIPT OR CSS FILES IN RAILS ASSETS?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, assets such as JavaScript and CSS files are organized in a\nspecific structure. They allow for the separation of code and resources, helping\nto maintain a clean, logical directory system for assets.\n\n\nDIRECTORIES FOR ASSETS\n\nThe assets, by default, are organized in the following directories:\n\n * app/assets/: For assets specific to the application\n * lib/assets/: For assets that are shared across the applications\n * vendor/assets/: For assets provided by third-party entities\n\n\nFOLDERS & FILES FOR ASSETS\n\nWithin these primary asset directories, subfolders are used to classify assets\nbased on their types, such as:\n\n 1. javascripts: For all JavaScript files, having the .js extension\n 2. stylesheets: For all CSS files, with the .css extension\n 3. images: For image files such as .jpeg, .png, etc.\n 4. fonts: For font files, such as .otf, .ttf, and .woff font files\n\nYou can include selective files in these folders or subfolders to manage the\nassets more effectively.\n\n\nMODIFYING ASSET PATHS\n\nThe asset pipeline makes use of the app/assets, lib/assets, and vendor/assets\ndirectories. You can also nest folders within these directories, providing\nmultiple layers of organization, such as:\n\napp/assets\n│\n├── javascripts\n│   └── welcome.js (Available under localhost/javascripts/welcome.js)\n│\n└── stylesheets\n    └── application.css (Available under localhost/stylesheets/application.css)\n\n\n\nASSET MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVES\n\nDIRECT REFERENCE\n\nAssets can be referenced directly in Rails' HTML views, ensuring that only\nnecessary assets are loaded on a page-by-page basis. However, this method comes\nwith some limitations, such as not using the asset pipeline's benefits.\n\nASSET PIPELINE FOR PREPROCESSING AND COMPRESSION\n\nUsing the asset pipeline is the recommended approach. It offers features like\npreprocessing and compression.\n\nRails parses the application.css and application.js files and bundles the\nreferenced files. These can be more effectively cached and loaded, prioritizing\nefficiency. Hence, using the asset pipeline is typically favored.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DIRECT REFERENCE VS. ASSET PIPELINE\n\nHere is the look at the code:\n\n<!-- Referencing JavaScript directly -->\n<script src=\"/javascripts/welcome.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Referencing CSS directly -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/stylesheets/application.css\">\n\n\nAdvantages of using Asset Pipeline:\n\n * For style/design consistency, global.css or application.css can be used to\n   link all the CSS files of an application.\n * Specific pages can load JavaScript or CSS files if required.\n * Statistics about the file can be accessed through manifest-.json to verify\n   the latest modification.","index":38,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"40.\n\n\nWHAT ARE DATA-* ATTRIBUTES AND HOW DO YOU USE THEM IN RAILS VIEWS?","answer":"Data-attributes are used in HTML to store custom data, offering a flexible and\ngeneric means for interoperability with client-side scripts. Rails 5.1 and later\nhave built-in support for data-attributes.\n\n\nKEY BENEFITS\n\n * Decoupling: Data-attributes can be used to separate view and script in web\n   applications.\n * Customization: They allow for custom, semantic data elements to be stored\n   with HTML elements.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n 1. Storing Specific Data: For instance, an item's unique ID can be used to\n    uniquely identify its position in a list, perform batch operations, or for\n    any other client-side logic.\n\n 2. Interactivity: Data-attributes are particularly useful in enabling\n    client-side interactivity, especially with JavaScript.\n\n 3. State Management: They can be used to store the state of an element enabling\n    dynamic rendering and providing consistent user experience.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES & CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Name Convention: Use lowercase, with hyphens separating multiple words (e.g.,\n   data-user-id).\n * Accessibility & SEO: Ensure data-attributes are not used as a substitute for\n   appropriate HTML elements or attributes, especially for content that needs to\n   be indexed or summarized by assistive technologies.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING DATA-ATTRIBUTES IN RAILS\n\nHere is the Rails View code:\n\n<% @items.each do |item| %>\n  <li class=\"item\" data-item-id=\"<%= item.id %>\" data-item-category=\"<%= item.category %>\">\n    <!-- Content to display -->\n  </li>\n<% end %>\n\n\nHere we stored item.id and item.category as data-item-id and data-item-category\nrespectively. This data can be accessed in the client-side script.\n\nQUERYING USING DATA-ATTRIBUTES\n\nIn the JavaScript:\n\n// Example - In this case, we are selecting an item to take an action on through its data attribute\nlet itemToProcess = document.querySelector('.item[data-item-id=\"123\"]');\nitemToProcess.remove();\n","index":39,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"41.\n\n\nWHAT IS TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD) AND HOW IS IT APPLIED IN RAILS?","answer":"In Test-Driven Development (TDD), developers first write test cases before\nimplementing the code. Rails emphasizes TDD, making it an integral part of the\ndevelopment process through the use of RSpec and Capybara.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS IN RAILS\n\n * RSpec: A testing framework that functions seamlessly with Rails. It uses\n   describe for contexts and it for expectations.\n\n * Capybara: A tool that allows for the simulation of web interactions in tests,\n   enabling checks for web application specifications and establishing\n   credibility in end-user functionality. It uses a Domain-Specific Language for\n   ***behavior-driven development (BDD)***, aligning actions with expected\n   outcomes.\n\n\nCORE WORKFLOW STEPS\n\n 1. Add a Test: Start with code that doesn't exist for the feature or\n    functionality you require.\n\n 2. Run all Tests (RED): Meticulously created tests ensure that the newly added\n    one should fail, as the code for the feature is yet to be written.\n\n 3. Write the Code: While the previous test stands inadequate due to\n    non-existence or insufficiency of the feature, you can now write the minimum\n    amount of code essential to meet the requirement.\n\n 4. Run Tests to Ensure They Pass (GREEN): Execute all the tests again. If a\n    recently added test and any existing tests pass, you can proceed without any\n    qualms.\n\n 5. Refactor: Once the feature is operational, you can tidy up your codebase\n    while guaranteeing that the tests remain unaltered.\n\n 6. Repeat: For every additional feature or enhancement, apply the same pattern\n    of RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. This helps maintain a meticulous and reliable test\n    suite while reinforcing the design process.\n\n\nTEST SUITE MAINTENANCE\n\nConstantly upgrading the software necessitates several types of tests,\nincluding:\n\n * Unit Tests: Validates individual components or units of the application, such\n   as methods or functions.\n\n * Integration Tests: Helps evaluate the correctness and interplay of various\n   different units or subsystems within the application.\n\n * Acceptance Tests: Guarantees the overall functioning of application features,\n   especially in connection with the system as a whole from an end-user\n   perspective.\n\n\nRELIABILITY ATTRIBUTES\n\n 1. Consistency: As a result of its systematic nature, TDD ensures uniform and\n    dependable system evaluations.\n\n 2. Coverage: By nature, TDD often leads to thorough code coverage, covering\n    multiple potential use-cases just within the course of developing the\n    feature.\n\n 3. Sustainability: Its emphasis on extensive and robust testing, combined with\n    automated validation mechanisms, ensures quality is consistently preserved.\n\n 4. Clarity in Expectations: TDD begins with the formulation of usage\n    specifications, fostering a clear understanding of expected outcomes.\n\n 5. Specification Precision: The tests set the exact operational parameters\n    before the code gets written. This precision assures precise adherence to\n    the requirements or expectations defined.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n 1. Comprehensive Assertions: Test every anticipated outcome and edge case to\n    guarantee the application's uniformity and accuracy over a wide array of\n    situations.\n\n 2. Continuous Validation: Run the test suite after every modification to\n    immediately detect any resulting errors.\n\n 3. Maintain Test Quality: As the application evolves, tests need to evolve\n    accordingly, without losing their quality.\n\n 4. Strive for Code Quality and Integrity: TDD encourages the sustenance of\n    superior code quality, which inevitably enhances the stability and\n    efficiency of the application.\n\n 5. Collaborative Development: Advocating for the collective creation and review\n    of tests ingrains shared understanding and vision for the application's\n    features.\n\n\nPROS AND CONS OF TDD IN RAILS\n\nPROS\n\n * Consistent Software Quality: From the initiation itself, TDD works towards\n   establishing and conserving superior software quality.\n\n * Thorough and Just-in-Time Documentation Generation: Precise and elaborative\n   tests serve as living documentation, keeping the system's behavior\n   well-documented and current.\n\n * Self-Validating Specifications: By running the tests, you derive a\n   confirmation of system compliance to defined behavior and functionality.\n\n\nCONS\n\n * Potential Overhead: While writing tests before code may appear slower\n   initially, it leads to heightened efficiency in subsequent development and\n   maintenance.\n\n * Disposition to Test AreEas and Not Necessarily the Best Ones: There remains\n   the possibility that the way conducted tests are not optimal in terms of\n   scenarios or their depth of coverage.\n\n * Learning Curve: Adapting to TDD, especially novices in the domain, might\n   present a non-negligible learning challenge.","index":40,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"42.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNIT, FUNCTIONAL, AND INTEGRATION TESTS IN\nRAILS.","answer":"Ruby on Rails emphasizes robust testing across its three main types: Unit,\nFunctional, and Integration Tests.\n\n\nUNIT TESTS\n\nThese tests focus on the smallest testable parts of an application - typically\nindividual methods or model attributes. They confirm that these parts operate as\nexpected in isolation.\n\nIn Ruby on Rails, you would use tools like Minitest, RSpec, or Shoulda Matchers\nfor organizing and running unit tests.\n\nEXAMPLE: UNIT TEST\n\nHere is the RSpec example:\n\n# spec/models/user_spec.rb\nrequire 'rails_helper'\nRSpec.describe User, type: :model do\n  it \"is not valid without an email\" do\n    user = User.new(email: nil)\n    expect(user).to_not be_valid\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nFUNCTIONAL TESTS\n\nFunctional tests evaluate the behavior of controllers in response to user\naction. They ensure that HTTP requests sent by the user are handled as expected\nby the server via associated URL routes, and result in an intended HTTP\nresponse.\n\nEXAMPLE: FUNCTIONAL TEST\n\nHere is a Minitest example:\n\nrequire 'test_helper'\nclass UsersControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase\n  test \"should get check_valid_email\" do\n    get :check_valid_email, params: { email: 'test@example.com' }\n    assert_response :success\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nINTEGRATION TESTS\n\nIntegration tests offer a higher level of validation than unit and functional\ntests by examining the interaction between different parts of the application.\nThis includes verifying if models, controllers, views, routes, and databases are\nin sync with each other.\n\nIn example, when you talk about Integration and Testing / Rails, its Rspec\npreferred:\n\n# spec/features/user_signs_in_spec.rb\nrequire \"rails_helper\"\nRSpec.feature \"User signs in\" do\n  scenario \"with valid email and password\" do\n    user = create(:user)\n    visit new_user_session_path\n    fill_in \"Email\", with: user.email\n    fill_in \"Password\", with: user.password\n    click_button \"Log in\"\n    expect(page).to have_content 'Signed in successfully.'\n  end\nend\n","index":41,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"43.\n\n\nHOW IS RSPEC USED IN RAILS TESTING?","answer":"RSpec is a popular behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework for Ruby.\nIt provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for testing that captures more than\njust method-level things you want to test.\n\nRSpec is often chosen for its readability, flexibility, and its capability to\nwrite descriptive specifications that focus on the expected behavior of the\napplication or individual components.\n\n\nKEY RSPEC CONCEPTS\n\nDESCRIBE & CONTEXT\n\n * describe: Provides an explanation of the subject under test (SUT). For\n   instance, if you are testing a Book model, you might have describe \"Book\" to\n   capture a set of validations for the Book model.\n * context: Often nested within describe blocks, it groups examples based on a\n   common context. It's a way to organize expectations based on a particular\n   state or condition, which helps in keeping the test suite clean, manageable,\n   and more understandable.\n\nIT & SPECIFY\n\n * it: Defines a specific example or test case within describe or context\n   blocks. Each it block should aim to test one specific behavior or aspect of\n   the subject under test.\n * specify: It's a more readable synonym of it. So, you can use either it or\n   specify based on your preference.\n\nBEFORE & LET (OR LET!)\n\n * before: Runs a setup block before each example within the describe or context\n   where it's defined. This is especially helpful for avoiding code duplication.\n * let/let!: Provides a convenient way to define memoized methods that can act\n   as a setup. They differ in that let! is eagerly evaluated, ensuring the setup\n   is always executed before the dependent examples.\n\n\nRSPEC MATCHERS\n\nRSpec provides matchers that enable you to express expected outcomes in a\nhuman-readable way, enhancing the readability and the diagnostic clarity of your\ntests.\n\nHere are some common built-in RSpec matchers:\n\n * expect().to\n * expect().to_not\n * be_truthy, be_falsey\n * be_nil\n * be_instance_of, be_kind_of\n * eq, be (for object identity)\n * include\n * respond_to\n * raise_error\n\nCUSTOM MATCHERS\n\nRSpec allows for creating custom matchers tailored to specific needs. This is a\npowerful feature that enables the expression of domain-specific expectational\noutcomes in a fluent and intuitive manner.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR RSPEC WRITING\n\n 1. Clarity and Consistency: Write tests that serve as a clear and thorough\n    project documentation, helping both present and future developers comprehend\n    the intended behavior of the code.\n 2. Data Independence in Tests: Whenever possible, ensure that test cases are\n    independent of one another. Each it block should operate self-contained\n    without influences or side-effects from others, ensuring predictable and\n    manageable results.\n 3. Isolation is Key: Aim for a high level of isolation in test cases. Use setup\n    and teardown strategies such as before and after, or let and let!, to keep\n    examples independent and encapsulated.\n 4. \"Fast\" Tests: Establish test cases that are quick to execute. This not only\n    conserves time but also encourages reliable and immediate feedback during\n    the development cycle.\n 5. Using let for Readability and Efficiency: Employ let to declare contextual\n    objects or values that are commonly utilized throughout multiple it blocks.\n    This enhances clarity and streamlines setups, promoting both efficiency and\n    consistency.\n 6. Visual Engagements with Helpers and Subject: Leverage subject and helper\n    methods for fluid and intuitive specification declarations. subject helps to\n    associate descriptions directly with the subject under test, offering a\n    readable narrative of your specifications.\n 7. Document Features with Examples: Employ descriptive example blocks that\n    provide examples of expected behaviors, yielding a functional and\n    instructive representation of how features should function or behave under\n    diverse situations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: RSPEC MATCHERS\n\nHere is the RSpec code:\n\nrequire 'calculator'\n\ndescribe Calculator do\n  let(:calculator) { Calculator.new }\n\n  context \"addition\" do\n    it \"can add two positive numbers\" do\n      expect(calculator.add(2, 3)).to eq(5)\n    end\n\n    it \"can add a negative number and a positive number\" do\n      expect(calculator.add(-2, 3)).to eq(1)\n    end\n  end\n\n  context \"subtraction\" do\n    it \"can subtract a smaller number from a larger number\" do\n      expect(calculator.subtract(5, 2)).to eq(3)\n    end\n  end\nend\n","index":42,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"44.\n\n\nWHAT IS CAPYBARA, AND WHAT ROLE DOES IT PLAY IN TESTING?","answer":"Capybara is a feature-rich web interaction library used primarily for automated\nbrowser testing in web applications.

Session Token: Rails verifies CSRF tokens found in forms and Ajax requests.\n 2. Stateful Root: Rails exempts GET requests and those targeting the\n    application domain.\n 3. HTTP Referrer: This optional method checks the referrer URL for non-local\n    requests.\n\n\nVERIFICATION IN TECHNICAL DETAIL\n\n * Session Token: A CSRF token is formed from the form_authenticity_token method\n   and stored in the session. Upon form submission, Rails compares the tokens\n   for a match.\n\n * Stateful Root and Bad Tokens: Non-GET requests to the application are\n   validated only if:\n   \n   * The session and the request are for the same host.\n   \n   * A valid CSRF token is present.\n   \n   * Non-GET and non-HEAD requests without a token are blocked. The specific\n     error message varies:\n     \n     * \"Forbidden\" typically indicates an expired session.\n     * \"An ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken exception\" is thrown when\n       the token is missing or invalid.\n\nNote: Referrer-based CSRF protection is disabled by default in Rails due to\npotential security risks. If enabled without HTTPS, URLs are exposed in\nplaintext.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the code:\n\n# config/initializers/session_store.rb\nRails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store, \n                                      key: '_your_app_session', \n                                      secure: true\n\n# app/controllers/application_controller.rb\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n  # ...\n\n  # Enable referrer-based CSRF protection\n  def allow_referrer\n    DddcffghbbbbbbbbvaniactionDispatch::Request.new(request.env).referer.present?\n  end\n\n  # Disable referrer-based CSRF protection\n  def skip_referrer\n    request.env['skip_referer_check'] = true\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn the above example, the config/initializers/session_store.rb file ensures that\nthe session cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS.\n\nIn app/controllers/application_controller.rb, two methods manipulate\nreferrer-based CSRF protection.

This token is validated when the form is submitted, effectively preventing\nCSRF attacks.\n\nSQL INJECTION\n\nRails' Active Record ORM uses parameterized SQL whenever possible, making it\nresistant to SQL injection. For instance, you can ensure safety in queries by\nusing where and or or Named scope methods.\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)\n\nRails sanitizes user-generated content by default, ensuring that it is safe to\nrender in views.\n\n * Avoiding Inline Script: Rails's ```javascript``` helper is designed to\n   execute external scripts.\n\n * HTML Escaping: Data being sent to the browser is HTML escaped, preventing any\n   unintended mishaps.\n\n * CDN Integrity: Rails 6 introduced SRI (SubResource Integrity), which checks\n   if the content of external resources is tampered with.\n\nINSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCES (IDOR)\n\nRails employs policies like using friendly routes and scoping parameters to\nprevent direct object references. An example of scoping parameters is:\n\n# In `routes.rb`\nresources :articles do\n  resources :comments\nend\n\n# In `comments_controller.rb`\ndef create\n  @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])\n  @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nBy finding the :article_id parameter within the scope of an article, you ensure\nthat the operation is on a valid and expected object.\n\nSECURITY MISCONFIGURATIONS\n\nRails has its security functions built-in, meaning security configurations are\nestablished by default. However, it still provides you with the flexibility to\nfine-tune and tailor security configurations to your specific needs if\nnecessary.\n\n\nADDITIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS IN RAILS\n\nLOGGING AND AUDITING ACTIONS\n\nRails, through its logging capabilities, is an effective tool for tracing user\nactions in the system. The built-in logging framework can be enhanced through\ntools like PaperTrail for robust audit trails.\n\nSSL/TLS\n\nRails adds an extra layer of security with SSL and TLS, encrypting data in\ntransit. It's crucial for web applications to use HTTPS for secure data\ntransfer.\n\nDATA ENCRYPTION\n\nRails offers a straightforward way to handle sensitive data at both the\napplication and database levels using various encryption methods. This ensures\nthat even if a data breach occurs, the sensitive information is not\nstraightforward to interpret.\n\nSTRONG PARAMETERS FOR MASS ASSIGNMENT SECURITY\n\nStrong parameters is a powerful validation tool that can significantly reduce\nthe risk of mass-assignment attacks. By designating only those parameters\nexplicitly allowed for model modifications, vulnerabilities stem from unchecked\nuser inputs.\n\nFILE UPLOADS\n\nRails allows or disallows certain types of files and their extensions. It\ndoesn't solely depend on client-side validation, which can be bypassed.\n\nRATE LIMITING\n\nRails, integrated with Devise, for example, has authentication mechanisms\npossessing rate-limiting policies on login attempts. If an account faces\nmultiple failed login attempts, the system can automatically delay or block\nfuture login requests, preventing malicious entities from gaining unauthorized\naccess.\n\nJOB QUEUE SECURITY\n\nWhen working with job queues, sensitive data is potentially at risk. Rails\ndiligently secures the data by encrypting it before being stored in any backend\n(like Redis or Sidekiq).\n\nEMAIL SECURITY\n\nSending emails securely is also a feature in Rails. Emails can be securely sent\nover SMTP servers supporting transport layer security (TLS) for secure delivery.\n\n\nALWAYS STAY UP-TO-DATE\n\nStaying up-to-date with the latest framework version is absolutely crucial for\nsecurity.

This approach meets the highest industry standards and is the\nrecommended method for password storage.\n\n\nBCRYPT\n\nBCrypt is a key-based cryptographic function that uses a system of adaptive hash\nfunctions based on a key. This approach adds a time inefficiency to help\nwithstand against brute-force attacks. Each time the password is hashed, a new\nhash-value gets generated, and together with the old hash-value, it is stored in\nthe database. This method guards against hashed-password leaks and enhances the\nsecurity even against the improved algorithms.\n\n\nBOUNDING BOX\n\nIn the context of password hashing, a bounded box serves as a protective layer.\nIt's a cryptographic container, warding off dictionary attacks, where\ncybercriminals seek to link a password hash with a word from a predefined list\nor dictionary. The BCryptBCryptBCrypt algorithm incorporates this mechanism,\nleveraging a higher level of salting compared to alternatives like\nSHA−256SHA-256SHA−256. This complexity positions BCryptBCryptBCrypt as a more\nreliable shield against such infiltration attempts.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING BCRYPT\n\n * Algorithm Underpinning: Disguising the algorithm underpinning the hash\n   confuses cybercriminals, translating to significantly reduced exposure to\n   hash-reversal attacks.\n * Salting Strength: Salting plays a vital role in preventing parallel attacks.\n   A stronger salt utility, \"peppering,\" can amplify its potency.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USER MODEL AND BCRYPT\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  validates :password, presence: true\n  has_secure_password\nend\n\n\nIn the code 'has_secure_password' command infers the password present and\nsecures the password using BCrypt. Also, checks the password.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: GENERATE HASH USING BCRYPT\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nmy_password = BCrypt::Password.create(\"my password\")\n#=> $2a$12$G6p7mr6O5VrA5CYNVHeJC.Yr9t0ZGY4x7ZlrMDF/NruJWwNtTV3G\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: VERIFY PASSWORD USING BCRYPT\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nmy_password = BCrypt::Password.new(\"$2a$12$G6p7mr6O5VrA5CYNVHeJC.Yr9t0ZGY4x7ZlrMDF/NruJWwNtTV3G\")\nmy_password == \"my password\"   #=> true\nmy_password == \"not my password\" #=> false\n","index":58,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"60.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE HAS_SECURE_TOKEN METHOD IN RAILS?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, the has_secure_token method is used for generating unique and\nsecure tokens. It is particularly handy in scenarios such as one-time usage for\npassword resets or email verification.\n\nThis method, initially introduced as part of ActiveModel::SecureToken, creates a\ncryptographically secure token. Each instance of the model will have a unique\ntoken associated with it.\n\n\nHOW HAS_SECURE_TOKEN WORKS\n\nThe core logic is tied to before_create callback. At the time of record\ncreation, the method sets the specified attribute to a freshly generated secure\ntoken.\n\n * The token won't be overwritten if it's already present, ensuring that\n   existing tokens are not accidentally invalidated.\n * Since the generation only happens on record creation, any manual assignment\n   to the respective attribute prior to saving will take precedence.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES AROUND SECURE TOKENS\n\n 1. Avoid Hard-Coding Tokens: Manually setting tokens might compromise security.\n    Rely on Rails to generate these tokens instead, as it employs cryptographic\n    libraries to ensure high levels of randomness and unpredictability.\n\n 2. Use HTTPS: Secure tokens should always be transmitted over HTTPS, especially\n    in web applications, to minimize interception risks.\n\n 3. Token Length: While the length can be customized, a length of 20 characters,\n    the default, is often sufficient for security.\n\n 4. Protection from Tracking: To make tokens less predictable, avoid\n    incorporating fine-grained timestamps or other predictable sequences in\n    token generation.\n\n 5. Secure Secrets: Ensure that the Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base or\n    config.secret_key_base is set securely in production for increased token\n    security.\n\n\nCODE WALKTHROUGH: HAS_SECURE_TOKEN\n\nHere is the Rails snippet:\n\n# User model\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\n  has_secure_token :auth_token\nend\n\n\nAfter you run a migration to add the auth_token column to the users table, newly\ncreated User instances will have a uniquely generated token stored in the\nauth_token column.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS\n\n * The method can take an optional argument allowing you to specify the\n   attribute's name. In the absence of an argument, it defaults to :token.\n * A hash can be provided, permitting the definition of additional\n   customization, such as the token's byte size.","index":59,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"61.\n\n\nDESCRIBE SOME WAYS OF OPTIMIZING THE PERFORMANCE OF A RAILS APPLICATION.","answer":"Rails applications can benefit from various performance optimizations,\nencompassing numerous layers, from caching to DB query efficiency.\n\n\nCACHING IN RAILS\n\n * Page Caching delivers static HTML for faster rendering.

The Decorator Pattern acts as a structural design pattern and adds\nbehaviors or responsibilities to individual objects dynamically, without\naffecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n * Decorators: These are like \"wrapping classes\" that alter the behavior of the\n   core object without actually changing its core logic.\n * Component: This defines the interface for both core objects and decorators so\n   that they can be used interchangeably.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DECORATOR PATTERN\n\nHere is the UML diagram:\n\nDecorator Pattern\n[https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/334994/UML_Decorator.png]\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Base component/interface\nclass Pizza\n  attr_reader :description, :cost\n\n  def initialize(description, cost)\n    @description = description\n    @cost = cost\n  end\n\n  def details\n    \"#{description} ($#{cost})\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Concrete component\nclass Margherita < Pizza\n  def initialize\n    super('Margherita Pizza', 8)\n  end\nend\n\n# Decorator: Topping\nclass ToppingDecorator < Pizza\n  attr_reader :pizza\n\n  def initialize(pizza, topping_description, topping_cost)\n    super(pizza.description + \" + #{topping_description}\", pizza.cost + topping_cost)\n    @pizza = pizza\n  end\nend\n\n# Concrete decorators\nclass ExtraCheese < ToppingDecorator\n  def initialize(pizza)\n    super(pizza, 'Extra Cheese', 2)\n  end\nend\n\nclass Jalapenos < ToppingDecorator\n  def initialize(pizza)\n    super(pizza, 'Jalapenos', 2.5)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nKEY ELEMENTS IN THE CODE\n\n * Base Component (Pizza): Acts as the interface for both core components and\n   decorators.\n * Concrete Component (Margherita): The primary object to which decorators will\n   be attached.\n * Base Decorator (ToppingDecorator): Responsible for forwarding requests to the\n   core object and providing the common structure for decorators.\n * Concrete Decorators (ExtraCheese, Jalapenos): Add specific behaviors, or in\n   our case, toppings, to the core object.\n\nIn this example, Pizza acts as the base component, and ToppingDecorator and\nPizza are classes.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE THE DECORATOR PATTERN\n\n * Avoiding Class Explosions: When you find yourself needing multiple classes,\n   each providing a slightly different variation of behavior.\n * Dynamic Object Responsibilities: When you want to be able to assign new\n   responsibilities to objects at run-time.\n * Maintaining Object's Transparency: When you need to add responsibilities to\n   an individual object, rather than an entire class of objects, without\n   affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF USING THE DECORATOR PATTERN\n\n * Open-Closed Principle: It allows for new behaviors to be added to individual\n   objects without modifying their class.\n * Transparent Extension: Decorators can be easily wrapped around core\n   components, making it clear which new behaviors are added.\n * Simplicity and Flexibility: Provides a way to add new functionalities as\n   needed, without the complexity of multiple inheritance.","index":73,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"75.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON RAILS ANTI-PATTERNS?","answer":"Let's look at the Common Rails anti-patterns:\n\n 1.  Callbacks Dependency Hell:\n     This stems from overreliance on ActiveRecord callbacks. It can result in\n     cascading behavior that's hard to debug or predict. Mitigate by introducing\n     observer objects or service objects for precise control of interrelated\n     actions.\n\n 2.  Fat ActiveRecord Models:\n     Referred to as the \"God Object\" anti-pattern, this is when an ActiveRecord\n     model takes on numerous roles, methods, and responsibilities. This hinders\n     predictability and paves the way for code that's hard to test and maintain.\n     Divide and conquer functionality using modules, single responsibilities,\n     and delegation.\n\n 3.  Deeply Nested Forms:\n     While often required for complex user interfaces, nested attributes and\n     deeply nested forms can lead to persistence issues, especially without\n     proper accepts_nested_attributes_for setup and form display logic. Consider\n     breaking these interfaces into smaller, more manageable parts or use\n     separate edit actions for nested resources.\n\n 4.  Overuse of has_and_belongs_to_many Associations:\n     This direct association pattern, which doesn't have an accompanying model,\n     can lead to complications. It lacks flexibility for additional attributes\n     or behavior unique to particular relationships. Where possible, opt for a\n     join model using has_many :through for a more explicit relationship\n     representation.\n\n 5.  Misuse of find_or_create_by:\n     Although convenient, this method comes with nuances, particularly in\n     multi-threaded environments. Multiple concurrent queries can lead to\n     unexpected data duplication. Instead, prefer using transactions or\n     database-level constraints to ensure data integrity.\n\n 6.  Overreliance on before_validation and before_save:\n     The excessive use of these callbacks can lead to cascading side effects,\n     making it challenging to understand when and how particular behaviors get\n     triggered. Consider more explicit ways to manage state changes, such as\n     state machines or public methods.\n\n 7.  Multiple Actions in a Single Controller Method:\n     By combining multiple actions in a single controller action, code can\n     become entangled and difficult to reason about. This violates the Single\n     Responsibility Principle (SRP). Aim for having clear, single-action, and\n     RESTful controllers.\n\n 8.  Using update_attribute or update_column Excessively:\n     These methods bypass validations and could lead to inconsistent or\n     unintended changes in the data, especially in more extensive codebases\n     where keeping track of every use might be hard. Instead, validate\n     attributes and use more robust update methods.\n\n 9.  N+1 Queries Abundance:\n     Indiscriminate use of queries that loads associations on the fly or within\n     iterations can lead to the dreaded N+1 query problem, causing unnecessary\n     performance hits. Aim to curate and eager load necessary associations.\n\n 10. Blind Trust in Business Logic:\n     Relying entirely on client-side and UI-based validations can expose your\n     application to inconsistencies. Always enforce data validity on the\n     server-side through model validations and associated business logic checks.","index":74,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"76.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE ROLE OF A PRESENTER IN THE RAILS ARCHITECTURE.","answer":"The Presenter pattern enhances code modularity and separation of concerns in\nRails applications.

MTI (Multiple Table Inheritance) and STI (Single Table Inheritance): Use\n    polymorphism, multiple table inheritance, STI along with concerns.\n\n 4. Service Objects: They delegate reusable, non-model-specific business logic.\n    They include related operational tasks and enable transformations before or\n    after data is persisted.\n\n 5. Form Objects: Form objects are utilized to consolidate complex forms or\n    model-backed forms. They can serve as a layer of abstraction between models\n    and views, effectively managing validations and complex form workflows.\n\n 6. Use Concerns (mix-in modules): Keep common behaviors across your models by\n    using Ruby's concern directive in your classes.\n\nIn Rails, a concern is defined using ActiveSupport::Concern.

This condensation is suited for classes that are closely related\nbut represent different types or roles.\n\nHaving one table for all types can simplify database design and management\ntasks. Additionally, it can be more performant in certain scenarios, as there's\nno need for costly JOIN operations to retrieve related data.\n\nHowever, mixing data for multiple models in a single table can lead to potential\nissues such as bloated tables with unused columns, less type safety, and more\ncomplex queries.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION IN RAILS\n\nDo define an \"Animal\" class that subclasses a common model, \"Mammal\".\n\nDATA MODELS IN RAILS\n\n# Migration file\nclass CreateMammals < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]\n  def change\n    create_table :mammals do |t|\n      t.string :name\n      t.boolean :is_domesticated\n      t.timestamps\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Animal and its subclasses\nclass Mammal < ApplicationRecord\n  self.inheritance_column = :mammal_type\n\n  scope :domesticated, -> { where(is_domesticated: true) }\nend\n\nclass Cat < Mammal; end\nclass Dog < Mammal; end\n\n\n\nPOLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATIONS\n\nPolymorphic Associations let an object belong to multiple types of objects\nthrough a single association.\n\nUsing polymorphic associations can help reduce the need for duplicating database\ncolumns across tables and rigid associations.

Here is a code example:\n\n# within a controller or a view\nI18n.locale = :fr\n\n\nIn the above code, I18n.locale is set to :fr (for French). The Resources\nController can utilize the I18n.t method to display related terms.\n\nWhen the locale is set to French, the function t('greeting') might return\n\"Salut\" instead of \"Hello\". The active locale has a significant impact on I18n\nprocesses.\n\n\nI18N IN VIEWS\n\nRails uses ERB (Embedded Ruby) for its views and I18n elements are no exception.\nIt's simple to substitute strings using the <%= t('key') %> syntax.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: I18N IN VIEWS\n\nHere is the ERB code:\n\n<%= t('greeting') %>\n\n\nIf the active locale corresponds to French, the above line might render as:\n\nSalut\n\n\n\nI18N FOR VALIDATION MESSAGES\n\nRails provides comprehensive in-built support for I18n but sometimes manual\nconfiguration is necessary. For instance, when working with ActiveRecord models,\none might need to specify translations for validation error messages. This is\ndone in the config/locales folder through a YAML file, such as\nconfig/locales/en.yml.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LOCALIZING VALIDATION MESSAGES\n\nHere is the YAML file example, for a User model:\n\nen:\n  activerecord:\n    models:\n      user: \"Person\"\n    attributes:\n      user:\n        email: \"E-mail\"\n        password: \"Password\"\n    errors:\n      models:\n        user:\n          attributes:\n            email:\n              blank: \"cannot be empty\"\n              invalid: \"is not valid\"\n\n\nIn this example, if the email field is empty when a user tries to sign up, Rails\nwill display: \"E-mail cannot be empty.\" instead of the default \"Email can't be\nblank.\"\n\nNote: This approach entirely eliminates the need to hard-code text in the\napplication, facilitating a more streamlined and robust internationalization\nexperience.","index":80,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"82.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT REAL-TIME FEATURES IN RAILS (E.G., ACTIONCABLE)?","answer":"Action Cable serves as Ruby on Rails' integrated solution for implementing\nreal-time features, establishing web socket connections for bidirectional\ncommunication.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n 1.

All HTTP requests and responses,\nas they flow through the app, use this object as an entry point.\n\n\nMIDDLEWARE\n\nRack has a modular design, and the web server and the application are separate\ncomponents, communicating via a construct known as middleware.\n\nThe middleware stack is a series of modules, including components like logging,\nerror handling, session, and more.\n\nRack acts as a facilitator for the HTTP stack, enabling external modules or\nmiddlewares to be easily integrated into the application. These middlewares can\noperate before the main application processing, post-processing the response, or\nboth.\n\nFor instance, the Rack::Logger middleware conducts request logging, while the\nRack::Session middleware manages user sessions. Entries in the middleware stack\nare often updated or swapped based on factors like the web environment or the\nURL accessed.\n\nIn Rails, middlware is defined by the config.ru file, also colloquially referred\nto as the \"rack up\" file.\n\n\nADAPTERS\n\nTo communicate with a web server, like Apache or Nginx, and handle HTTP requests\nand responses, Rack applications use adapters. Common adapter options are\nRack::Handler::WEBrick or Rack::Handler::Thin, but there are many others.\n\nThe choice of adapter depends on the production environment, with some web\nservers, like Passenger, supporting Rack apps without any adapter.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC RACK APPLICATION\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n 1. config.ru: The Rack configuration file typically for a Rails app.\n 2. app.rb: The actual Rack app.\n\nCONFIG.RU\n\nrequire_relative 'app'\nrun App.new\n\n\nAPP.RB\n\nclass App\n  def call(env)\n    ['200', {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ['Hello, Rack!']]\n  end\nend\n","index":86,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"88.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MONITOR A RAILS APPLICATION IN PRODUCTION?","answer":"Monitoring a Rails application in production is essential for detecting\nperformance issues and potential threats.

They\nallow you to build smaller, self-contained pieces of functionality that can then\nbe shared and reused across different applications.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Self-contained: Engines come with their own models, views, and controllers.\n   They are essentially smaller Rails applications that can be mounted within a\n   larger one.\n * Namespacing: This feature lets engines operate within a separate namespace,\n   preventing naming conflicts.\n * Mounting: Engines are mounted within your application's routes.rb file,\n   defining the base URL they'll be accessible from.\n * Isolated: By default, engines are isolated, meaning they don't have direct\n   access to the application that mounts them.\n\n\nTYPICAL USE-CASES\n\n * Reusability: Code that can be shared across multiple applications, like user\n   management or a public API.\n * Modularity and Team Collaboration: For large teams where different teams or\n   individuals work on separate parts of the application without affecting each\n   other's code.\n * Testing and Release Strategies: Distinct engines allow for more focused\n   testing and independent release cycles.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING ENGINES\n\n 1. Generating an Engine: Use the rails plugin new command to create a new\n    engine. Alternatively, you can use bundle gem and configure it manually as\n    an engine.\n\n 2. Defining Dependencies: Specify in the engine's .gemspec file any\n    dependencies it needs. The host application will then install these when the\n    engine is included.\n\n 3. Mounting the Engine: Inside the config/routes.rb of the host application,\n    use mount MyEngine::Engine, at: '/some_path' to set the base path for the\n    engine.\n\n 4. Enabling Eager Loading: In the host application's config/application.rb\n    file, ensure that the engine's directory is eagerly loaded by adding\n    config.eager_load_paths << Rails.root.join('path', 'to', 'engine',\n    'folder').\n\n 5. Accessing Shared Relationships: For relationships that involve both the host\n    application and the engine, remember to specify the engine namespace. For\n    example, if a User in the engine has many Posts, the relationship in the\n    engine will be has_many :posts, class_name: 'MyEngine::Post'.\n\n\nSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhile engines are a great tool for modularity, setting up the appropriate\nsecurity measures is crucial.

Its release cycle\ncategorizes versions into three stability levels. These include:\n\n\nVERSION NUMBERING\n\nRuby on Rails follows a three-part versioning system made up of the format:\nX.Y.Z\n\n * X: The major version, which reflects significant enhancements or changes that\n   are likely to require updates in your application.\n * Y: The minor version, indicating smaller but noteworthy upgrades and new\n   features.\n * Z: The patch version, referring to bug fixes and security updates.\n\n\nRELEASE CATEGORIES\n\n 1. Stable: Regular releases suitable for production. These versions are tested\n    through various pre-release stages.\n 2. Long-Term Support (LTS): Designed for prolonged stability, these versions\n    benefit from continued security updates and maintenance for a set duration.\n 3. Edge: The most recent development version. It's not thoroughly tested and\n    might introduce breaking changes, but it provides the earliest access to new\n    features and improvements.\n\nIndividual Rails components, such as Action Cable and ActiveRecord, also follow\nthe X.Y.Z versioning model.\n\n\nMODIFYING GEMFILE\n\nWhen implementing a specific version of Ruby on Rails, you can modify your app's\nGemfile as follows:\n\ngem 'rails', '6.1.3'\n\n\nOr you can specify a version range:\n\ngem 'rails', '~> 6.1.0'  # Selects the latest patch version in the 6.1.x series\n\n\nTo indicate a range between specific versions:\n\ngem 'rails', '>= 6.0', '< 7.0'  # Selects any version above 6.0 and below 7.0\n","index":95,"topic":" Ruby on Rails ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"97.\n\n\nHOW DOES THE RUBY VERSION AFFECT A RAILS APPLICATION?","answer":"While both Ruby and Ruby on Rails are interdependent, it's important to\ndistinguish their individual roles.\n\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUBY AND RUBY ON RAILS\n\n * Ruby: A dynamic, object-oriented scripting language.
