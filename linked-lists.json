Hash Tables, on the other\n   hand, can have memory overhead due to hash functions, collision handling, and\n   the need for extra space to prevent performance degradation.\n\n * Access Time: Both data structures require O(1)O(1)O(1) time complexity for\n   certain operations. Hash Tables are known for this in most cases, but Linked\n   Lists can be equally efficient for operations that take place solely at\n   either end of the list.\n\n * Duplication Handling: Linked Lists can directly store duplicate values. In\n   Hash Tables, they can be tricky to manage because they require unique keys.\n\n * Data Persistence and Disk Storage: Linked Lists are more conducive to\n   persistent data storage, such as disk storage, because of their sequential\n   data storage and easy disk access via pointers.\n\n\nUSE CASE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nCOMMON USE CASES FOR LINKED LISTS\n\n * Dynamic Allocation: When you need a dynamic allocation of memory that's not\n   limited by fixed table sizes, Linked Lists can expand and contract\n   efficiently.\n * Efficient Insertions/Deletions: For these operations in the middle of a list,\n   implementing them on Linked Lists is particularly straightforward and\n   efficient.\n * Sequential Data Processing: Certain tasks like linear search or the traversal\n   of ordered data are simpler to perform with Linked Lists.\n * Persistent Data Storage: When data persistence is a concern, such as for\n   persistent caches, Log-structured File Systems, or databases with transaction\n   logs.\n * Memory Compactness: In scenarios where memory segmentation or disk access\n   indirectly impacts performance, the undivided blocks in Linked Lists can be\n   an advantageous choice.\n\nCOMMON USE CASES FOR HASH TABLES\n\n * Quick Lookups: For rapid retrieval of data based on a unique key, Hash Tables\n   shine.\n * Memory Mapped File Access: Especially beneficial for very large data sets\n   when practical, as it can reduce I/O cost.\n * Cache Performance: Their fast access and mutation operations make them ideal\n   for in-memory caching systems.\n * Distinct Value Storage: Best suited when each key must be unique. If you try\n   to insert a duplicate key, its existing value is updated, which can be useful\n   in multiple contexts, like address tables in a network.","index":11,"topic":" Linked Lists ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"13.\n\n\nIS IT POSSIBLE TO TRAVERSE A LINKED LIST IN O(N1/2)?
