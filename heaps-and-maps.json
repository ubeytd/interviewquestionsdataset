[{"text":"1.\n\n\nWHAT IS A HEAP?","answer":"A Heap is a tree-based data structure that is commonly used to implement\npriority queues. There are two primary types of heaps: Min Heap and Max Heap.\n\nIn a Min Heap, the root node is the smallest element, and each parent node is\nsmaller than or equal to its children. Conversely, in a Max Heap, the root node\nis the largest element, and each parent node is greater than or equal to its\nchildren.\n\n\nKEY CHARACTERISTICS\n\n * Completeness: All levels of the tree are fully populated except for possibly\n   the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n * Heap Order: Each parent node adheres to the heap property, meaning it is\n   either smaller (Min Heap) or larger (Max Heap) than or equal to its children.\n\n\nVISUAL REPRESENTATION\n\nMin and Max Heap\n[https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/heaps%20and%20maps%2FMin-Max-Heap.png?alt=media&token=cb792085-64d2-4093-bc6f-c202463178cb]\n\n\nCOMMON IMPLEMENTATION: BINARY HEAP\n\nThe Binary Heap is a popular heap implementation that is essentially a complete\nbinary tree. The tree can represent either a Min Heap or Max Heap, with sibling\nnodes not being ordered relative to each other.\n\nARRAY REPRESENTATION AND INDEX RELATIONSHIPS\n\nBinary heaps are usually implemented using an array, where:\n\n * Root: heap[0]\n * Left Child: heap[2 * i + 1]\n * Right Child: heap[2 * i + 2]\n * Parent: heap[(i - 1) // 2]\n\n\nCORE OPERATIONS\n\n 1. Insert: Adds an element while maintaining the heap order, generally using a\n    \"heapify-up\" algorithm.\n 2. Delete-Min/Delete-Max: Removes the root and restructures the heap, typically\n    using a \"heapify-down\" or \"percolate-down\" algorithm.\n 3. Peek: Fetches the root element without removing it.\n 4. Heapify: Builds a heap from an unordered collection.\n 5. Size: Returns the number of elements in the heap.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE METRICS\n\n * Insert: O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn)\n * Delete-Min/Delete-Max: O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn)\n * Peek: O(1)O(1)O(1)\n * Heapify: O(n)O(n)O(n)\n * Size: O(1)O(1)O(1)\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MIN HEAP\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Utility functions for heapify-up and heapify-down\ndef heapify_up(heap, idx):\n    parent = (idx - 1) // 2\n    if parent >= 0 and heap[parent] > heap[idx]:\n        heap[parent], heap[idx] = heap[idx], heap[parent]\n        heapify_up(heap, parent)\n\ndef heapify_down(heap, idx, heap_size):\n    left = 2 * idx + 1\n    right = 2 * idx + 2\n    smallest = idx\n    if left < heap_size and heap[left] < heap[smallest]:\n        smallest = left\n    if right < heap_size and heap[right] < heap[smallest]:\n        smallest = right\n    if smallest != idx:\n        heap[idx], heap[smallest] = heap[smallest], heap[idx]\n        heapify_down(heap, smallest, heap_size)\n\n# Complete MinHeap class\nclass MinHeap:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.heap = []\n\n    def insert(self, value):\n        self.heap.append(value)\n        heapify_up(self.heap, len(self.heap) - 1)\n\n    def delete_min(self):\n        if not self.heap:\n            return None\n        min_val = self.heap[0]\n        self.heap[0] = self.heap[-1]\n        self.heap.pop()\n        heapify_down(self.heap, 0, len(self.heap))\n        return min_val\n\n    def peek(self):\n        return self.heap[0] if self.heap else None\n\n    def size(self):\n        return len(self.heap)\n","index":0,"topic":" Heaps And Maps ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nWHAT IS A PRIORITY QUEUE?","answer":"A Priority Queue is a specialized data structure that manages elements based on\ntheir assigned priorities.

It achieves O(1)O(1)O(1) average case complexity for key-based\noperations such as lookup, insert, and delete.\n\nIn a theoretical sense, the hash function plays the pivotal role of translating\nkeys into distinct array indices. This step ensures that keys are evenly\ndistributed across the array.\n\n\nVITAL COMPONENTS\n\nA Hash Map consists of:\n\n * Key: Identifies a value. Keys are unique within the map.\n * Value: The data associated with a key.\n * Bucket: A container, typically an array, that stores key-value pairs.\n\nA hash map maintains a dynamic array of buckets to adapt to the size and volume\nof data, allowing for efficient hash collisions management.\n\n\nADDRESSING COLLISIONS\n\nCollisions happen when two keys are hashed to the same slot. There are two main\nstrategies to handle collisions:\n\n * Separate Chaining: Uses linked lists or more efficient data structures like\n   trees to resolve colliding keys and distribute them across the same or\n   adjacent buckets. Retrieve operations follow the pointer chain, fetching the\n   correct value.\n\n * Open Addressing: When a slot is occupied, the algorithm probes the table to\n   find the next available slot, typically based on a sequence derived from the\n   hash value. The disadvantage of this approach is that the presence of one key\n   in a bucket can change the location of the subsequent keys based on the\n   collision resolution strategy used.\n\n\nCOMMON CHALLENGES WITH OPEN ADDRESSING\n\nOpen Addressing, while simple in its approach, presents challenges and possibly\ncompromises on performance factors.\n\nCLUSTER FORMATION\n\nWhen contiguous slots are repeatedly probed in open addressing, key-value pairs\ncluster together. This phenomenon is known as primary clustering. Post-probing\nclusters are also possible, named secondary clustering.\n\nThe clusters make the map more susceptible to collisions, resulting in an uneven\ndistribution of keys, which can degrade the retrieval performance.\n\nCOST OF REHASHING\n\nIn dynamic arrays, frequent resizing is suboptimal because it carries a large\noverhead cost: the need to rehash existing keys.

These properties are especially crucial for time-critical\n   applications like word editing and auto-completion.\n\n * Term Uniqueness: The nature of sets provided by the key-only functionality of\n   maps ensures that each term is distinct, essential for tasks like counting\n   term frequencies in texts.\n\n * Linked Information: Both maps and their key-value pairs in more complex\n   structures provide a way to access related data quickly. This capability is\n   essential for tasks like stemming and lemmatization or for exploring\n   relationships between words.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONSTRUCTING AN INVERTED INDEX\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef build_inverted_index(document):\n    index = defaultdict(set)\n    for word in document.split():  # Assume whitespace tokenization\n        index[word.lower()].add(word)  # Ensure case-insensitivity\n    return index\n\ndocument = \"This is a test document.
