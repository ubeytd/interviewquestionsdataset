[{"text":"1.\n\n\nWHAT IS KUBERNETES, AND WHY IS IT USED FOR CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION?","answer":"Kubernetes provides a robust platform for deploying, scaling, and managing\ncontainerized applications. Unlike Docker Swarm, which is specifically designed\nfor Docker containers, Kubernetes is container-agnostic, supporting runtimes\nlike Containerd and CRI-O. Moreover, Kubernetes is more feature-rich, offering\nfeatures such as service discovery, rolling updates, and automated scaling.\n\n\nKEY KUBERNETES FEATURES\n\nPOD MANAGEMENT\n\n * Why: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, encapsulating one\n   or more containers. This brings flexibility and makes it effortless to manage\n   multi-container applications.\n\n * Core Concepts: Deployments, Replication Controllers, and ReplicaSets ensure\n   that a specific number of replicas for the Pod are running at all times.\n\n * Code Example: In YAML, a Pod with two containers might look like:\n   \n   apiVersion: v1\n   kind: Pod\n   metadata:\n     name: pod-with-two-containers\n   spec:\n     containers:\n     - name: container1\n       image: image1\n     - name: container2\n       image: image2\n   \n\nNETWORKING\n\n * Why: Kubernetes assigns each Pod its unique IP address, ensuring\n   communication across Pods. It also abstracts the underlying network,\n   simplifying the deployment process.\n * Core Concepts: Services, Ingress, and Network Policies provide different\n   levels of network abstraction and control.\n\nPERSISTENT STORAGE\n\n * Why: It offers a straightforward, standardized way of managing storage\n   systems, making it a great solution for databases and stateful applications.\n * Core Concepts: Storage classes, Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent\n   Volume Claims (PVCs) abstract the underlying storage technologies and provide\n   dynamic provisioning and access control.\n\nCLUSTER SCALING\n\n * Why: Kubernetes can automate the scaling of Pods based on CPU or memory\n   usage, ensuring optimal resource allocation and performance.\n * Core Concepts: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) dynamically scales the number\n   of replica Pods in a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet. Cluster\n   autoscaler scales underlying infrastructure, including nodes.\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\n\n * Why: Kubernetes makes it easy to manage and allocate resources (CPU and\n   memory) to different components of an application, ensuring that no single\n   component degrades overall performance.\n * Core Concepts: Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges help define the upper limits\n   of resources that each object can consume.\n\nBATCH EXECUTION\n\n * Why: For quick, efficient tasks, Kubernetes provides a Job and a CronJob API\n   to manage such tasks.\n * Core Concepts: Jobs and CronJobs manage the execution of Pods over time,\n   guaranteeing the desired state.\n\nCLUSTERS MAINTENANCE\n\n * Why: Kubernetes enables non-disruptive updates, ensuring cluster maintenance\n   without downtime.\n * Core Concepts: Rolling updates for Deployments and Pod disruption budgets\n   during updates help maintain availability while updating.\n\nHEALTH CHECKS\n\n * Why: Kubernetes actively monitors and checks the health of containers and\n   workloads, ensuring quick remediation in case of issues.\n * Core Components: Liveness and Readiness probes are used to determine the\n   health of container-based applications. Kubernetes restarts containers that\n   don't pass liveness probes and stops routing traffic to those that don't pass\n   readiness probes.\n\nSECRETS MANAGEMENT\n\n * Why: Kubernetes provides a secure way to manage sensitive information, such\n   as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.\n * Core Components: Secrets and ConfigMaps are different types of objects used\n   to centrally manage application configuration and secrets.\n\nAUTOMATED DEPLOYMENTS\n\n * Why: Kubernetes facilitates gradual, controlled updates of applications,\n   reducing the risk of downtime or failure during deployment.\n * Core Concepts: Deployments, with their built-in features like rolling updates\n   and rollbacks, provide a mechanism for achieving zero-downtime deployments.\n\nMETADATA AND LABELS\n\n * Why: Labels help organize and select and workloads in a Kubernetes cluster,\n   and annotations can attach arbitrary non-identifying information to objects.\n * Core Components: Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes\n   resources to give them identifying attributes. Annotations are used to attach\n   arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects.\n\nMECHANISM TO EXTEND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n * Why: Kubernetes is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to write\n   and register custom controllers or operators that can manage any object.\n\n\nMULTI-CLUSTER DEPLOYMENT\n\nKubernetes provides capabilities for effective multi-cluster deployment and\nscaling, be it within a single cloud provider or across hybrid and multi-cloud\nenvironments. With tools like Kubefed, you can define and manage resource\nconfigurations that are shared across clusters.\n\n\nCOST AND PRODUCTIVITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nKubernetes also offers significant cost efficiencies. It optimizes resource\nutilization, utilizing CPU and memory more effectively, reducing the need for\nover-provisioning.\n\nOn the productivity front, Kubernetes streamlines the development and deployment\npipelines, facilitating agility and enabling rapid, consistent updates across\ndifferent environments.\n\n\nWHY CHOOSE KUBERNETES FOR ORCHESTRATION?\n\n * Portability: Kubernetes is portable, running both on-premises and in the\n   cloud.\n * Scalability: It's proven its mettle in managing massive container workloads\n   efficiently, adapting to varying resource demands and scheduling tasks\n   effectively.\n * Community and Ecosystem: A vast and active community contributes to the\n   platform, ensuring it stays innovative and adaptable to evolving business\n   needs.\n * Extensive Feature Set: Kubernetes offers rich capabilities, making it\n   suitable for diverse deployment and operational requirements.\n * Reliability and Fault Tolerance: From self-healing capabilities to rolling\n   updates, it provides mechanisms for high availability and resilience.\n * Automation and Visibility: It simplifies operational tasks and offers\n   insights into the state of the system.\n * Security and Compliance: It provides role-based access control, network\n   policies, and other security measures to meet compliance standards.\n\n\nMASTER-NODE ARCHITECTURE\n\nKubernetes follows a master-node architecture, divided into:\n\n * Master Node: Manages the state and activities of the cluster. It contains\n   essential components like the API server, scheduler, and controller manager.\n   \n   * API Server: Acts as the entry point for all API interactions.\n   * Scheduler: Assigns workloads to nodes based on resource availability and\n     specific requirements.\n   * Controller Manager: Maintains the desired state, handling tasks like node\n     management and endpoint creation.\n   * etcd: The distributed key-value store that persists cluster state.\n\n * Worker Nodes: Also called minions, these are virtual or physical machines\n   that run the actual workloads in the form of containers. Each worker node\n   runs various Kubernetes components like Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and a container\n   runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd).\n\n\nNEED FOR ORCHESTRATION\n\nContainers, while providing isolation and reproducibility, need a way to be\nmanaged, scaled, updated, and networked. This is where Orchestration platforms\nlike Kubernetes come in, providing a management layer for your containers,\nensuring that they all work together in harmony.","index":0,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE ROLES OF MASTER AND WORKER NODES IN THE KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE.","answer":"In a Kubernetes cluster, each type of node has a distinct responsibility:\n\n * Master Node:\n   \n   * Also known as Control Plane Node, it manages the entire cluster.\n   * Houses the API Server, Controller Manager, and Scheduler, primarily\n     responsible for cluster orchestration.\n   * It initializes and configures workloads, spans across several Master nodes\n     to ensure high availability, and typically doesn't run user applications.\n   * Also, the etcd database is often hosted separately or as a clustered data\n     store.\n\n * Worker Node:\n   \n   * Also called Minion or Ingress Node.\n   * Serves as the compute layer of the cluster and by design hosts the\n     containers that make up the actual workloads ('pods') or app services.\n   * Acts as a bridge to offload the networking and monitoring overhead from the\n     Master node and to ensure the security of the cluster.\n\n * Other Nodes:\n   \n   * Special-purpose nodes or clusters may introduce other node types, such as\n     dedicated storage or networking elements. However, these are not universal\n     and won't be found in most standard Kubernetes setups.\n\nIt is essential to understand the distinct roles of these node types for\neffectively managing a Kubernetes cluster.\n\n\nKUBERNETES CLUSTER OVERVIEW\n\n * Nodes: Physical or virtual servers that form the worker or master nodes.\n   \n   * May also include additional specialized nodes for storage, networking, or\n     other purposes.\n\n * Kubelet: An agent installed on each worker node and helps the node connect\n   with the main control panel. It takes PodSpecs, which define a group of\n   containers that require to be coordinated, and guarantees that the identified\n   containers are running and healthy.\n\n * Kube-Proxy: A network agent on each node for managing network connectivity to\n   local deployments.\n\n * Control Panel: A collection of critical processes steamy on a cluster's\n   master nodes to regulate the cluster management and API server.\n   \n   * API Server: Resembles the front door to the cluster. All external\n     communications cease here.\n   * Scheduler: Picks the best node for a program to run on.\n   * Controller manager: Monitors the present state of the cluster and attempts\n     to bring it to the desired state.\n\n * External Cloud: Offers the physical hardware where your cluster will run.","index":1,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nHOW DO PODS FACILITATE THE MANAGEMENT OF CONTAINERS IN KUBERNETES?","answer":"In Kubernetes, a Pod serves as the smallest deployable unit, generally\nencapsulating a single application. The primary function of the Pod is to\nprovide a cohesive context for executing one or more containers.\n\n\nKEY CHARACTERISTICS\n\n * Context Sharing: Containers within the same Pod share a common network\n   namespace, hostname, and storage volumes, optimizing their interactions.\n\n * Logical Bundling: Designates one of the containers as the primary application\n   with the remaining containers often providing supplementary services or\n   shared resources.\n\n * Atomicity: Containers in a single Pod are scheduled onto the same node and\n   execute in close proximity. This ensures that they are either all running or\n   all terminated.\n\n\nCORE FUNCTIONALITIES\n\n 1. Networking: Containers within the same Pod are reachable via localhost and\n    have a single, shared IP address. This design simplifies internal\n    communication.\n\n 2. Resource Sharing: All containers in a Pod have identical resource-sharing\n    provisions, ensuring that they have the same CPU and memory limits.\n\n 3. Storage Volumes: Shared volumes can be mounted across all containers within\n    a Pod to promote data sharing among its constituent containers.\n\n 4. Lifecycle Coordination: Defines the life cycle for all containers in a Pod,\n    such that if one container exits, the termination affects the entire Pod,\n    consistent with the atomic execution concept.\n\n\nCORE RELATIONSHIP WITH WORKLOADS\n\n * Dedicated Workloads: Pods that host a single container are often used for\n   self-sufficient, standalone tasks. These tasks have specific resource\n   requirements and are designed to run independently.\n\n * Coordinated Workloads: Pods with multiple containers emphasize\n   complementarity. These containers often tackle related tasks, such as syncing\n   data, logging, or serving as administrative dashboards.\n\n\nYAML CONFIGURATION\n\nHere is the YAML configuration:\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: primary-container\n      image: primary-image\n    - name: secondary-container\n      image: secondary-image\n  volumes:\n    - name: shared-data\n      emptyDir: {}\n\n\nIn this instance, primary-container is the main application container, and\nsecondary-container is the auxiliary container. Both containers share the same\nstorage volume shared-data.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT TOOLS\n\nPopular dev-ops tools, like Helm, provide higher-level abstractions for managing\nKubernetes resources, such as the Pod. This simplifies deployment and scaling\ntasks, allowing for centralized configuration management.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF POD:\n\n * Resource Efficiency: Pods refrain from having resource duplication. Each\n   constituent container operates within the same resource environment, reducing\n   wastage.\n\n * Lifecycle Consistency: All containers in a Pod are deployed, scaled, and\n   managed as a single unit, promoting consistency in their execution.","index":2,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT TYPES OF SERVICES EXIST IN KUBERNETES, AND HOW DO THEY FACILITATE POD\nCOMMUNICATION?","answer":"Kubernetes offers different types of services for flexible & reliable\ncommunication between pods. Let's explore each.\n\n\nSERVICE TYPES\n\nCLUSTERIP\n\n * Role: Internal communication within the cluster.\n * How it Works: Pods communicate with the Service's fixed IP and port. Service\n   distributes traffic among pods based on defined selector.\n * Practical Use: Ideal for back-end services where direct access from external\n   sources isn't necessary.\n\nNODEPORT\n\n * Role: Exposes the Service on a static port on each node of the cluster.\n * How it Works: In addition to the ClusterIP functionality, it also opens a\n   specific port on each node. This allows external traffic to reach the service\n   through the node's IP address and the chosen port.\n * Practical Use: Useful for reaching the service from outside the cluster\n   during development and testing phases.\n\nLOADBALANCER\n\n * Role: Makes the Service externally accessible through a cloud provider's load\n   balancer.\n * How it Works: In addition to NodePort, this service provides a cloud load\n   balancer's IP address, which then distributes traffic across Service Pods.\n * Practical Use: Especially useful in cloud settings for a public-facing,\n   production deployment.\n\nEXTERNALNAME\n\n * Role: Maps the Service to an external service using a DNS name.\n * How it Works: When the Service is accessed, Kubernetes points it directly to\n   the external (DNS) name provided.\n * Practical Use: Useful if you want environments to have a uniform way of\n   accessing external services and don't want to use environment-specific\n   methods like altering /etc/hosts.\n\nHEADLESS\n\n * Role: Disables the cluster IP, allowing direct access to the Pods selected by\n   the Service.\n * How it Works: This type of Service doesn't allocate a virtual IP (ClusterIP)\n   to the Service, letting the clients directly access the Pods. It returns the\n   individual Pod IPs.\n * Practical Use: Useful for specialized use cases when direct access to Pod IPs\n   is necessary.\n\n\nSELECTORS AND ENDPOINTS\n\nFor many types of Service, the selector identifies which Pods to include in the\nservice. The matching Pods are called endpoints for the Service.\n\nKubernetes retrieves these endpoints from the API server, and the Service\nkube-proxy sets up appropriate iptables rules (or equivalent on other platforms\nor using ipvs) to match the Service behavior.\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp\n    type: Frontend\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 9376\n\n\nHere, the Service 'my-service' selects all the Pods with labels app=MyApp and\ntype=Frontend and forwards the traffic on the port 80 to the targetPort 9376.","index":3,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF NAMESPACES IN KUBERNETES.","answer":"Kubernetes uses Namespaces to create separate virtual clusters on top of a\nphysical cluster. This enables multi-tenancy, providing a powerful way to manage\ndiverse workloads efficiently.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Resource Isolation: Namespaces offer a level of separation, ensuring\n   resources like pods, services, and persistent volumes are distinct to a\n   Namespace.\n\n * Network Isolation: Each Namespace has its IP, enabling isolated network\n   policies and container-to-container communication.\n\n\nUSE-CASES\n\nDEVELOPMENT, TESTING, AND STAGING\n\n * Multi-Environment Segregation: Namespaces can delineate development, testing,\n   and staging environments.\n\nMULTI-TEAM AND MULTI-PROJECT SUPPORT\n\n * Multi-Tenancy: Namespaces allow multiple teams to work independently in the\n   same cluster.\n\n * Client Isolation: Service objects in a Namespace are only visible to clients\n   in the same Namespace, providing clear-cut network boundaries.\n\nSECURITY AND POLICY ENFORCEMENT\n\n * Resource Quotas: Namespaces help establish quotas to govern resource\n   consumption for projects or teams.\n\n * Limit Ranges: Namespaces can define minimum and maximum limitations on\n   resource memory and CPU for each container.\n\nNETWORK SEGMENTATION AND IP MANAGEMENT\n\n * Ingress Configuration: Namespaces assist in external-to-internal network\n   mapping and traffic routing.\n\n * IP Management: Each Namespace can have distinct IP ranges to uniquely\n   identify services and pods.","index":4,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nDIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DEPLOYMENTS, STATEFULSETS, AND DAEMONSETS.","answer":"Kubernetes offers various abstractions to manage containerized applications\naccording to specific operational needs.

In the context of failure scenarios or manual scaling, it is\nessential to understand how ReplicaSets guarantee pods are up and running\naccording to the defined configuration.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Pod Template: It specifies the required state for individual pods within the\n   configured ReplicaSet.\n\n * Controller-Reconciler Loop: This Control Plane component continuously\n   monitors the cluster, compares the observed state against the desired state\n   specified in the ReplicaSet, and takes corrective actions accordingly. If\n   there's a mismatch, this loop is responsible for making the necessary\n   adjustments.\n\n * Replica Level: Each ReplicaSet specifies the desired number of replicas. It's\n   the responsibility of the Controller-Reconciler Loop to ensure that this\n   count is maintained.\n\n\nACTION WORKFLOW\n\nINITIAL DEPLOYMENT\n\nDuring the initial setup, the ReplicaSet creates the specified number of pods\nand ensures they are in an Up state.\n\nOBSERVATION AND FEEDBACK LOOP\n\nThe Controller-Reconciler continuously monitors pods. If the observed state\ndeviates from the Pod Template, corrective action is initiated to bring the\nsystem back to the specified configuration.\n\n * Failure Detection: If a pod is unavailable or not matching the defined\n   template, the Controller-Reconciler identifies the anomaly in the system.\n\n * Self-Healing: The Controller-Reconciler instantiates new pods, replaces\n   unhealthy ones, or ensures the required number of pods is available,\n   maintaining the ReplicaSet's defined state.\n\nHORIZONTAL SCALING\n\nThe ReplicaSet allows for dynamic scaling of pods in response to changes in\ndemand.\n\n * Auto-Scaling: The Controller-Reconciler automatically scales the number of\n   pods to match the configured thresholds or metrics.\n\n * Manual Scaling: Administrators can manually adjust the number of replicas.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: AVAILABILITY REPORTING SYSTEM\n\nKubernetes YAML:\n\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: ReplicaSet\nmetadata:\n  name: av-replicaset\n  labels:\n    tier: frontend\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: availability\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: availability\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: av-reporter\n        image: av-reporter:v1\n\n\nIn this example, we ensure that two pods of the av-reporter:v1 image are\ncontinuously available, serving as a live status reporter for an availability\nsystem.","index":6,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nWHAT ARE JOBS IN KUBERNETES, AND WHEN IS IT SUITABLE TO USE THEM?","answer":"In Kubernetes, a job object is used to run a specific task to completion or a\ncertain number of times.

It defines rules\n   and settings for how traffic should be routed.\n\n * Ingress Controller: The Ingress Controller is in charge of obeying the\n   Ingress Resource's rules and configuring the load balancer and traffic\n   routing. Most often, the Ingress Controller is implemented through a\n   Kubernetes extension or a third-party tool, like NGINX or Traefik.\n\n * Load Balancer: Operating at layer 7 of the OSI model, the Load Balancer\n   directs traffic to available services based on rules. The Ingress Controller\n   configures and manages this Load Balancer on behalf of the cluster.\n   \n   Note: A cloud provider might offer its own Load Balancer, but the Ingress\n   Controller can also use standard cloud provider tools or its own mechanism if\n   the cluster isn't on a cloud platform.\n\n * Rules: These are defined within the Ingress Resource and specify how incoming\n   traffic should be handled. Rules typically match a specific path or domain\n   and define the associated backend Kubernetes service.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE INGRESS\n\nIngress is an ideal fit for clusters needing to route HTTP or HTTPS traffic.\nIt's especially beneficial in microservices architectures, as it centralizes and\nsimplifies access to services. This, in turn, improves security, ease of\nmanagement, and facilitates traffic optimizations like caching.\n\nIt should be noted that newer configurations, such as gateway API, offer more\nextensibility and include features such as traffic splitting and enhanced\nsecurity measures, which might make them a better choice in certain contexts.","index":11,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"13.\n\n\nEXPLAIN KUBERNETES DNS RESOLUTION FOR SERVICES.","answer":"Kubernetes leverages a consistent, centrally managed Domain Name System (DNS)\nfor containers and services, offering ease of discovery and effictive\ncommunication within the cluster.\n\n\nCORE DNS VS. KUBERNETES DNS\n\nIn early versions of Kubernetes, SkyDNS powered service discovery. However,\nCoreDNS has succeeded it as the default DNS server.\n\n * CoreDNS is more extendable and easier to manage.\n * Its modular nature means you enable specific features through plugins.\n\n\nDNS RESOLUTION WORKFLOW\n\n 1. Nodes and pods use kube-dns or coredns as their predefined DNS servers.\n 2. The DNS server typically resides within a Kubernetes cluster and knows all\n    service names and their IP addresses.\n 3. On receiving a DNS query, the DNS server tracks IP changes and ensures\n    name-to-IP mapping.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: QUERY FLOW\n\n 1. Pod Initiates DNS Request: A pod wants to connect to a service inside or\n    outside the cluster.\n 2. DNS Query: The pod sends a DNS query via the specified server (K8s or\n    custom).\n 3. DNS Server: The server processes the query.\n 4. Query Results: Based on pod's namespace, service name, and domain suffix,\n    the DNS server returns the corresponding IP(s).\n\n\nDNS REQUIREMENTS IN THE CLUSTER\n\n * Service Discovery: Pods need to locate services. DNS offers an effective way,\n   abstracting the complexity of directly handling service discovery.\n * Name Resolution: Pods and other entities use DNS to get a service's IP\n   address. The DNS server ensures efficient updates, so pods always have the\n   most accurate IP.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR INTER-POD COMMUNICATION\n\n 1. Direct Cluster IP: Services communicate via Cluster IP.\n 2. Unrestricted or Port-Defined Communication: Use the service type of\n    \"ClusterIP\".\n 3. Custom Domains: For custom domains, specify appropriate service names so the\n    DNS server properly resolves their IPs.\n\n\nNAMESPACE SEGREGATION\n\nWithout namespace information, separate services with the same name and\ndifferent namespaces might be unreachable. Including namespace info ensures\naccuracy.\n\n\nKEY CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n\n * pod / spec.dnsPolicy: Set ClusterFirst to utilize the default DNS service.\n * pod / spec.dnsConfig: Specify configs for custom DNS.\n * service : Utilize spec.clusterIP for manual IP assignments.

However, Pods require network isolation, which\nCNI providers, like Calico, address.\n\nKubernetes initiates and manages the CNI connectivity process as follows:\n\n 1. Network Attachment Definitions (NADs): Kubernetes 1.18 and later supports a\n    custom resource called Network Attachment Definitions. This allows operators\n    to specify that a Pod should have a particular network interface.\n\n 2. Multus CNI: This open-source CNI plugin enables Kubernetes Pods to have\n    multiple network interfaces. With Multus, you can use different CNI plugins\n    to assign either overlay or underlay network interfaces to the Pods.\n\n 3. Kubelet Configuration: Kubelet, an essential Kubernetes component on each\n    node, is responsible for integrating CNI providers.

API Server Triggers: By interacting with the pod lifecycle events, the API\n    server can trigger CNI when pods require network interfaces.\n\n 5. CoreDNS Integration: CoreDNS acts as a plugin for Kubernetes DNS, providing\n    a unified method for service discovery.\n\n 6. Use Throughout the Stack: After establishing a network, CNI serves an\n    essential role in the Kubernetes stack, including in Service and Ingress\n    controller configurations.\n\n 7. DaemonSets: Operators use DaemonSets to run CNI plugins on every Kubernetes\n    node. This ensures network configuration consistency across the cluster.\n\n 8.

They're well-suited for segregating\nresources based on organizational structures.\n\nNamespaces allow finer resource management using quotas, limit ranges, and roles\nand provide default networking isolation. However, they do require some\nmanagement for secure isolation.\n\nRESOURCE QUOTAS\n\nPolicy-based restrictions from Resource Quotas manage resource usage (CPU,\nmemory, and count) within a Namespace. They ensure that a tenant doesn't get\nprecedence over others or the cluster itself.\n\nResource Quotas mainly focus on preventing overcommitment, striving for\nfairness. They are like a \"speedometer\" – they prevent tenants from using more\nthan their fair share, but they don't ensure that the resources left are\ndistributed evenly among other tenants.\n\nLIMIT RANGES\n\nLimit Ranges further refine resources in a Namespace by standardizing the upper\nand lower bounds for certain resources, like memory and CPU, enhancing\npredictability and preventing abuse by a single tenant.\n\nROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL\n\nRBAC defines and limits user or service account access rights within namespaces,\neffectively preventing unauthorized resource usage.\n\nNETWORK POLICIES\n\nNetwork Policies control traffic flow between pods or network segments in a\nmulti-tenant cluster, contributing to security and isolation.\n\nPOD SECURITY POLICIES\n\nWhile Pod Security Policies aren't enabled by default in some Kubernetes\ndistributions anymore, they remain a viable option in others for setting\npod-level security rules.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\n * Shared Kernel Space: Unless using advanced networking plugins or solutions\n   like gVisor, all pods in a cluster still share the cluster's kernel.\n   Therefore, a rogue or compromised pod can potentially impact others if strict\n   Network Policies or other safeguards are not in place.\n\n * Single Tenant for Node: Each node in a Kubernetes cluster typically runs all\n   the pods from a single tenant, but there's no strict isolation between\n   tenants on a given node. Resources are partitioned using QoS classes\n   (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort).\n\n\nNEWER MULTITENANT ARCHITECTURES IN KUBERNETES\n\nShared Responsibility Model: This strategy empowers both administrators and\nusers to ensure cluster security and stability.\n\nOperator-Level Multitenancy: Leveraging Operator SDK, this approach automates\nthe management of tenant resources, ensuring they remain within agreed quotas\nand effectively \"self-heal\" when in violation.\n\ngRPC API-based Multitenancy: Implementing APIs with gRPC, this strategy ensures\ntenant separation and assists in efficient resource management.","index":41,"topic":" Kubernetes ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"}]
