[{"text":"1.\n\n\nWHAT IS NEXT.JS AND WHAT ARE ITS MAIN FEATURES?","answer":"Next.js stands out as a production-grade React framework, offering both speed\nand specialization. Its versatility, data fetching techniques, search engine\noptimization (SEO), and various deployment options make it a top choice for\nmodern web development.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n 1.  Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js dynamically generates the HTML on the\n     server for each page request, delivering consistently rendered content to\n     users and ensuring optimal SEO.\n\n 2.  Static Site Generation (SSG): By pre-computing the HTML of individual pages\n     at the build time, Next.js achieves superior performance and security. It's\n     especially adept at handling content-heavy websites.\n\n 3.  Hybrid Rendering: Combining SSR and SSG, Next.js provides the flexibility\n     to render specific pages during build time (SSG) and others on-demand\n     (SSR). This feature is valuable when creating applications comprising both\n     dynamic and static content.\n\n 4.  Routing: Opt for either filesystem-based or dynamic routing. The former\n     obviates the need for explicit route definition while the latter enables\n     programmatic control. Both options synergize with SSG and SSR.\n\n 5.  Code Splitting: Out of the box, Next.js identifies separate sections of\n     your app and optimizes the bundling, dispatching only the necessary code\n     (and resources) to clients, benefiting both performance and load times.\n\n 6.  Formidable Image Optimization: Image components from Next.js automate image\n     optimization, ensuring picture quality for varying devices while still\n     upholding rapid load times.\n\n 7.  Instant Deployment: Rely on services like Vercel for swift, straightforward\n     deployments, A/B testing, and other advanced features.\n\n 8.  API Routes: Embrace Next.js API routes for seamless incorporation of\n     backend resources into your application.\n\n 9.  Built-in CSS Support: With Next.js, you can utilize standard CSS files, CSS\n     modules, or even preprocessors like Sass, all without additional setup.\n\n 10. Vast Plugin Ecosystem: Extend the functionality of your Next.js project by\n     plugging into a wide array of solutions from the Next.js community.","index":0,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nHOW DOES NEXT.JS DIFFER FROM CREATE REACT APP?","answer":"Let's look at the key differences between Next.js and Create React App.\n\n\nCORE FUNCTIONALITY\n\n * Next.js: Built-in server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering\n   (CSR). It also supports static site generation (SSG). Offers features like\n   pre-fetching data to enhance performance. Provides integrated API routing.\n\n * Create React App: Primarily focuses on client-side rendering (CSR). Doesn't\n   provide built-in server-side rendering or advanced rendering modes such as\n   SSG or ISR. Relies on third-party solutions for server-side rendering.\n\n\nROUTING\n\n * Next.js: Offers file-system-based routing, which simplifies route definition.\n   It also supports custom routes. Dynamic routing and code splitting are\n   automatic, enhancing performance.\n\n * Create React App: Utilizes client-side routing with packages like React\n   Router. Routes need to be explicitly defined in a configuration file or as\n   components.\n\n\nFILE STRUCTURE AND CONFIGURATION\n\n * Next.js: Employs a zero-configuration model for quick setup. It comes with\n   sensible defaults that promote best practices. Added configuration options\n   can further customize its behavior.\n\n * Create React App: Similar to Next.js, it uses a zero-configuration approach.\n   Customizations are managed via react-scripts and some advanced, but\n   extensive, eject configurations. This step irrevocably detaches from the\n   default configuration, making it harder to integrate future updates.\n\n\nAPI HANDLING\n\n * Next.js: Integrates seamless serverless API routes. Developers can design API\n   endpoints using standard HTTP requests. The result is a simplified backend\n   setup without the need for server management or additional server logic.\n\n * Create React App: Leverages libraries like Axios or Fetch to interact with\n   backend services. Unlike Next.js, it doesn't have a built-in solution for\n   server-side API routes.\n\n\nCODE SPLITTING\n\n * Next.js: Automatically code-splits imports across pages and components. This\n   on-demand loading optimizes initial page load times. Furthermore,\n   module-level or even granular control over code splitting are possible.\n\n * Create React App: Incorporates the React.lazy function and Suspense\n   components to facilitate code splitting. Developers need to identify points\n   for code splitting manually.\n\n\nDATA FETCHING\n\n * Next.js: Offers numerous approaches for data retrieval, such as\n   getStaticProps, getStaticPaths, getServerSideProps, and client-side methods.\n   These functions are part of the Data Fetching API and are tailored for\n   specific rendering strategies.\n\n * Create React App: Lacks specialized data-fetching techniques inherent in\n   Next.js. Instead, it integrates with data-fetching libraries or employs\n   traditional strategies such as using useEffect in functional components.\n\n\nDEPLOYMENT\n\n * Next.js: Provides flexible deployment options. With serverless hosting,\n   deploys are efficient and scalable, especially suited for small to medium\n   projects. Traditional hosting with a Node.js server allows for more extensive\n   customizations.\n\n * Create React App: Most suitable for static or single-page applications, often\n   deployed via content delivery networks (CDNs). For dynamic content, it needs\n   to be paired with a backend like a REST API, and then deployed as two\n   distinct applications.\n\n\nSEO AND META-TAGS\n\n * Next.js: Offers superior support for search engine optimization (SEO). It\n   covers foundational aspects like meta tags, but its advanced rendering modes,\n   such as SSG and ISR, significantly benefit SEO, which is especially critical\n   for content-heavy sites.\n\n * Create React App: Lacks built-in mechanisms like SSR or specialized rendering\n   modes for optimizing SEO. Developers have to leverage third-party tools or\n   implement their own solutions to achieve search engine friendliness.","index":1,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT COMMAND IS USED TO CREATE A NEW NEXT.JS APP?","answer":"To create a new Next.js application, you can utilize npx in combination with the\ncreate-next-app package.\n\nnpx create-next-app folder-name\n\n\nReplace \"folder-name\" with your desired workspace directory.

Initial Request: When a user accesses a specific route or page, Next.js\n    intercepts this request.\n 2. Data Fetching: Any necessary page data is fetched, ensuring it's available\n    before the page is rendered.\n 3. SSR Render: Next.js renders the requested page on the server and sends the\n    generated content, including any fetched data, as a response to the user's\n    initial request.\n\nBENEFIT: IMMEDIATE DATA DISPLAY\n\nSince page content and data are rendered on the server and sent in the initial\nresponse, users see meaningful content faster, even for dynamic, data-driven\npages.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC NEXT.JS PAGE\n\nHere's the typical structure of a Next.js page:\n\nimport Head from 'next/head';\n\nconst SamplePage = ({ data }) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Head>\n        <title>Sample Page</title>\n      </Head>\n      <h1>Sample Content</h1>\n      <p>{data}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Perform necessary data fetching\n  let data = 'Some server-rendered data';\n  return { props: { data } };\n}\n\nexport default SamplePage;\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * The data-fetching function, getServerSideProps, ensures the data is available\n   before the page is rendered. This method is specifically for Server-Side\n   Rendering in Next.js.\n * The data prop, obtained from the data-fetching function, is passed to the\n   SamplePage component before its initial rendering. This permits immediate\n   display of relevant data.\n * The Head component from next/head encapsulates metadata specific to the page,\n   such as the title.\n\n\nTHE DATA-HYDRATION STAGE\n\nAfter the initial server-side rendering, the client-side JavaScript takes over.\nThis process involves:\n\n * Page Navigation: Whenever the user navigates to a new page within the\n   application.\n * Client-Side Routing: The browser takes control over route changes, and\n   Next.js manages the synchronization.\n * Data Fetching: If required, Next.js triggers additional data fetching on the\n   client side for subsequent state updates or dynamic content changes.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: NEXT.JS LINK COMPONENT\n\nHere is the code:\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nconst Navigation = () => {\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">\n        <a>About</a>\n      </Link>\n      <Link href=\"/contact\">\n        <a>Contact</a>\n      </Link>\n    </nav>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Navigation;\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * The Link component encapsulates anchor tags, ensuring user navigation within\n   the application is efficient and considers both server-rendered content and\n   any subsequent client-rendered updates.\n\n\nOPTIMAL USER EXPERIENCE\n\n * Initial Server Response: Delivers server-rendered content and necessary data\n   in the first request, improving perceived loading times.\n * Enhanced Dynamic User Experience: Seamlessly combines server-rendered content\n   with client-side updates, optimizing page state and content.","index":3,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE PAGES DIRECTORY IN A NEXT.JS PROJECT?","answer":"The pages directory serves as your primary route definition tool in a Next.js\napp. Each file within it represents a unique URL.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Automatic Routing: No custom routing is needed. Any file added to pages\n   becomes a route.\n\n * File-Route Mapping: The file structure under pages maps to specific routes.\n   For instance, pages/post/index.js is associated with /post.\n\n * Dynamic Routes: Files using square brackets like [id].js allow for dynamic\n   parameters. For example, pages/post/[id].js is tied to /post/:id.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: PAGES AND ROUTES\n\nConsider the following file structure:\n\npages/\n  ├── index.js\n  │\n  ├── post/\n  │    └── [id].js\n  │\n  └── about.js\n\n\nThis structure corresponds to the following routes:\n\n * /index.js: Serves as the landing page.\n\n * /post: Serves the post route. Should contain code to handle non-id requests.\n\n * /about.js: Direct route to the about page and is also treated as a route.\n\n * /post/abc:\n   \n   * Maps to pages/post/[id].js with id as \"abc\".\n\n\nSPECIAL ROLES\n\nSome specific filenames or subdirectories have distinct routing roles.\n\n * 404.js: If present, Next.js uses this file to render a custom 404 page.\n * _app.js: Sits at the top level. It is the master page that wraps other pages.\n   Useful for including global styles or contexts.\n * _document.js: Also on the top level, controls the server-rendered HTML\n   document. Strong for continuous UI across pages.","index":4,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nIN NEXT.JS, HOW DO YOU CREATE A PAGE THAT IS RENDERED ON THE SERVER FOR EVERY\nREQUEST?","answer":"In Next.js, you can configure server-side rendering for pages that always need\nfresh data. A good example is a real-time dashboard or a data-driven landing\npage.\n\n\nSERVER-SIDE RENDERING (SSR) VS. STATIC GENERATION (SG)\n\n * SSR: This sends the request to the server on every visit to fetch fresh data\n   and generate the HTML response. This approach is often necessary if the data\n   changes frequently.\n * SG: All requests serve pre-built HTML, ideal for content that doesn't change\n   upon every visit. However, SG could become inappropriate for certain\n   use-cases where real-time data is a requirement.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING SSR IN NEXT.JS\n\nTo enable SSR in Next.js, follow these practical steps:\n\n 1. Configure Your Page's Component:\n    \n    * Along with the standard static getStaticProps method, include\n      getServerSideProps for server-side rendering.\n    * This method runs on every request, making it suitable for dynamic data.\n    * Ensure you export this method within your page component.\n\n 2. Using the Data:\n    \n    * getServerSideProps should return the necessary data, as is common for\n      data-fetching methods in Next.js.\n    * Data will be available as props to your page component.\n\n 3. Deploy on a System that Supports SSR:\n    \n    * Next.js delivers SSR out-of-the-box, which means you do not need to change\n      any configurations to support this concern.\n    * For efficiency, you may utilize a caching mechanism to shape data that\n      stays constant between subsequent requests.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: PAGE REQUIRING SERVER-SIDE RENDERING\n\nHere is the code:\n\n 1. Page Component: Pages/ServerSide.js\n    \n    export default function ServerSide({ time }) {\n      return <p>Current time: {time}</p>;\n    }\n    \n    export async function getServerSideProps() {\n      return {\n        props: {\n          time: new Date().toISOString(),\n        },\n      };\n    }\n    \n    \n    This code provides a time prop that updates on each request, showcasing\n    server-side rendering.\n\n 2. Linking in Your Application: ParentComponent.js\n    \n    import Link from 'next/link';\n    \n    export default function ParentComponent() {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <Link href=\"/ServerSide\">Live Time Page</Link>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n    \n    \n    Users see the updated time each time they access the \"Live Time Page.\"","index":5,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nWHAT FILE EXTENSIONS DOES NEXT.JS SUPPORT FOR PAGES?","answer":"Next.js allows great flexibility in defining page components, supporting a\nvariety of file extensions.\n\n\nSUPPORTED EXTENSIONS\n\n * .js: Traditional JavaScript.\n * .jsx: React with JavaScript.\n * .ts: TypeScript.\n * .tsx: React with TypeScript.\n\n\nTEXT FORMATS\n\n * .mdx: MDX for markdown with JSX extensions, enabling interactivity.\n\n\nSTYLING COMPONENTS\n\n * .css: Standard CSS.\n * .module.css: CSS Modules for local scoping.\n * .scss: SCSS, with its extended features and nesting.\n\n\nDATA FETCHING\n\n * .fetch.js: Client-side data fetching.\n * .fetch.ts: Client-side TypeScript data fetching.\n\n\nERROR HANDLING\n\n * _error.*: Special filename used to define custom error pages.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n * Page using .jsx and .scss\n\n// myPage.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport styles from './myPage.module.scss';\n\nconst MyPage = () => {\n  return <div className={styles.myPage}>Hello, SCSS!</div>;\n};\n\nexport default MyPage;\n\n\n * MDX file with React components and styling\n\n// myMDXPage.mdx\nimport MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent';\nimport './myMDXPageStyles.css';\n\n# My MDX Page\n\n<MyComponent />\n","index":6,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nHOW DO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES WORK IN NEXT.JS?","answer":"Environment variables in Next.js are used to configure deployment-specific\nvalues.\n\nSERVER, BUILD, AND CLIENT-SIDE ENV VARS\n\n * Server: Required before app/web server starts, e.g., API keys.\n * Build: For settings during the build process.\n * Client: For global client-side use.

Page Analysis: During build time, Next.js analyzes each page to determine if\n    it fetches data. If not, the page is marked for static optimization. This\n    often includes pages that only use internal state, client-side libraries, or\n    context.\n\n 2. Prerendering: For pages marked as static, Next.js generates HTML files\n    during the build process. These optimized pages are then served without\n    requiring server-side rendering.\n\n 3. Data Revalidate: Static pages can contain stale data. Next.js uses a\n    revalidate strategy to periodically refresh data. This is an ideal trade-off\n    for many applications, balancing performance and data accuracy.\n\n\nUSE CASES\n\n * Content Pages: Ideal for content-rich pages, such as blogs or marketing\n   content, where the data doesn't change frequently and a slight delay in\n   updates is acceptable.\n * Marketing Campaigns: For promotional campaigns or one-time events, where\n   real-time data isn't a priority and quick initial page loads are crucial.\n\n\nCACHING AND LIMITATIONS\n\n * Client Cache: Since individual users might be served cached static pages,\n   client-side data can still become out-of-date. Techniques like incremental\n   static regeneration (ISR) offer better freshness guarantees by updating pages\n   at specified intervals.\n\n * Data Dependencies: Pages dependent on fresh, external data need server-side\n   or hybrid rendering. Otherwise, they risk serving outdated content.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING GETSTATICPROPS & GETSERVERSIDEPROPS\n\n// pages/product/[id].jsx\n\n// Using getStaticProps for static optimization\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const product = await someFetchFunction(params.id);\n  return {\n    props: { product },\n    revalidate: 10, // Regenerate every 10 seconds for a more updated page\n  };\n}\n\n// If real-time data is an absolute must, use getServerSideProps instead\nexport async function getServerSideProps({ params }) {\n  const product = await someFetchFunction(params.id);\n  return { props: { product } };\n}\n\nfunction Product({ product }) {\n  // Render product details\n}\n","index":8,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"10.\n\n\nHOW DOES FILE-BASED ROUTING WORK IN NEXT.JS?","answer":"File-based routing in Next.js simplifies the organization of web application\npages. By adhering to specific file naming conventions in tandem with dedicated\nfolders, developers can seamlessly structure their Next.js projects.\n\n\nMECHANISM\n\nThe presence of JavaScript or Markdown files under specific directories signals\nNext.js to configure pages within the application. For instance, navigational\nlinks can be established using file directory structure.\n\nKEY DIRECTORIES\n\n * The pages directory serves as the root where the application pages are\n   located.\n * Secondary folders, such as pages/blog, represent sections within the\n   application.\n\nFILE FORMATS\n\n * For a standard page, use a .js or .jsx extension, or .ts/.tsx for TypeScript.\n * For blog or documentation-like sections, .mdx (Markdown and React hybrid) can\n   be employed, allowing content to render alongside components.\n\n\nBENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS\n\nBENEFITS:\n\n * Straightforward Navigation: The project's structure in the pages directory\n   mirrors the website's structure.\n * Modularity: Sections are self-contained in separate directories, contributing\n   to a more manageable and structured codebase.\n * Isomorphism Support: The presence of both client- and server-side code\n   fosters web applications that run on both the client and server, enhancing\n   SEO and initial load times.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n * Limited to Core Directories: Unique configurations might necessitate stepping\n   beyond the capabilities of file-based routing, demanding additional setup.\n * Directory Depth Complexity: Managing a large number of deeply nested\n   directories can be challenging, potentially triggering comprehension or\n   performance issues.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: FILE-BASED ROUTING\n\nConsider a simple e-commerce website.\n\nBelow is the directory structure:\n\npages/\n|__ index.js\n|__ cart.js\n|__ products/\n     |__ index.js\n     |__ [product-id].js\n\n\nIn the above structure, we see:\n\n * pages/index.js: Serves as the landing page.\n * pages/cart.js: Represents the shopping cart accessible via yoursite.com/cart.\n * pages/products/index.js: Defines the 'Products' landing page.\n * pages/products/[product-id].js: Corresponds to a product details page,\n   accessible with the product's unique identifier, for example,\n   yoursite.com/products/123.","index":9,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"11.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU CREATE DYNAMIC ROUTES IN NEXT.JS?","answer":"Dynamic Routes in Next.js allow you to render pages or components based on URL\nparameters.

You\n    define it within a Next.js page component to fetch initial data. The method\n    primarily applies to older versions of Next.js before v9.3.\n\n 2. SWR: The hook useSWR brings client-server synchronization into your React\n    components. It's especially valuable for data that changes regularly. Also,\n    SWR is advantageous because it operates robustly with server-side rendering\n    and data prefetching.\n\n 3. useEffect: For data fetching dependent on side-effects (e.g., HTTP\n    requests), utilize the useEffect hook. This approach is a fitting choice for\n    less predictable or one-time data requirements.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DATA FETCHING WITH SWR\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr';\n\nfunction GithubUser() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR(`https://api.github.com/users`, fetcher);\n\n  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>;\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n\n  return <div>{data.map(user => (\n    <div key={user.id}>{user.login}</div>\n  ))}</div>;\n}\n\nexport default GithubUser;\n\n\n\nBENEFITS OF ON-DEMAND CLIENT-SIDE DATA FETCHING\n\n * Reduced Initial Load: By fetching data only when necessary, you ensure an\n   efficient and quicker first page load.\n * Expressive Data Management: Flexibility to access data outside of the\n   pre-rendered static or server-rendered page.\n * Interactive User Experience: Real-time or server-synced data updates enable\n   engaging, responsive applications.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n * Performance: Use client-side data sparingly, as an overabundance of\n   late-fetched data can lead to suboptimal first-page load times.\n * SEO and Web Scraping: For content discoverability, ensure that essential data\n   is readily available during the initial render.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n 1. Optimization: Monitor and if necessary, fine-tune the timing and volume of\n    client-side data fetches.\n 2. Use-Cases Suitability: Prioritize client-side data for interactions, such as\n    search results or live chat, requiring minimal initial data.\n 3. Defensive Design: Plan for scenarios where client-side data could be absent\n    or stale, ensuring users receive consistent information.\n\n\nNEXT.JS DIRECTIVES AND GUIDELINES\n\nStay updated with the latest Next.js releases and best practices.

Error Thrown: When an error occurs (for example, through an API request, or\n    even a 404 on the server), Next.js catches it.\n\n 2. Error Page Determination: The determined error status code will be used to\n    show the appropriate error page.\n\n 3. Error Page Rendering: Next.js will select the nearest (or closest matching)\n    error page and render it.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZING ERROR PAGES\n\nTo create more tailored error pages, you can customize them based on status\ncodes. Follow these steps:\n\n 1. Define Custom Pages: Set up specific error page components with these\n    standard HTTP status codes: 404, 500, 501, 503. For instance, for a 404\n    error, create 404.js.\n\n 2. Render Custom Pages: In the root of your project, a special error page\n    component, _error.js, acts as a fallback for all error types that don't have\n    a specific error page.\n\nSAMPLE _ERROR.JS:\n\nHere is the React Component:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\nconst Error = ({ statusCode, message }) => {\n  let errorMsg;\n  \n  if (statusCode) {\n    errorMsg = `An error ${statusCode} occurred on server`;\n  } else {\n    errorMsg = `An error occurred on client`;\n  }\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Error</h1>\n      <p>{errorMsg}: {message}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nError.getInitialProps = async ({ res, err }) => {\n  const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : 404;\n  return { statusCode, message: (err && err.message) || '' };\n};\n\nError.defaultProps = {\n  statusCode: 404,\n  message: ''\n};\n\nError.propTypes = {\n  statusCode: PropTypes.number,\n  message: PropTypes.string\n};\n\nexport default Error;\n\n\nIn this example for _error.js, the getInitialProps method is essential. It's\nused to retrieve the error status code and optional server error from either the\ncontext's res object or the err object.\n\n\nPROS AND CONS OF CUSTOM ERROR HANDLING\n\nPROS\n\n * Improved UX: Tailor-made error pages enhance user experience and offer clear,\n   consistent messaging.\n * Visual Consistency: Customize the look and feel of error messages to align\n   with your application's style.\n\nCONS\n\n * Complexity: The process might be more involved, requiring additional\n   components and code to manage error pages.\n * Management Overhead: Maintaining consistent error messaging across custom\n   error pages can be a challenge.","index":36,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"38.\n\n\nWHAT FOLDER STRUCTURE IS RECOMMENDED FOR LARGE-SCALE NEXT.JS APPLICATIONS?","answer":"When working on large-scale Next.js applications, a thoughtful folder structure\ncan make a significant difference in terms of organization, collaboration, and\nmaintenance.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Modularity: Each module should be self-contained and have clear\n   responsibilities.\n * Discoverability: Make it easy for team members to find the files they need.\n * Consistency: Adopt a consistent structure to reduce cognitive load for\n   developers.\n\n\nCOMMON FOLDER STRUCTURES\n\nFLAT APPROACH (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n\nThis structure may, in some cases, lead to clutter and poor module\nencapsulation.

Good for server-rendered\n   initial data. They can fetch data and pass it to the page as props.\n\n * Custom Hooks: Helps segregate the state logic and provides more reusability.\n   This method is versatile and can be used with the Context API or simple\n   global objects like window.\n\n * Context API: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without\n   having to pass props down manually at every level.\n\n * APOR (Avoid Passing Props Through): This strategy suggests minimizing the use\n   of Context or global states to avoid decreasing code modularity and\n   maintainability.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Server-side Rendering: Many global state solutions are client-centric, which\n   might not be ideal for SSR. Using getInitialProps or getServerSideProps to\n   pre-fetch data to pass to the components is a common practice.\n\n * Code Splitting: With Next.js, you also have server-side and client-side\n   bundling control. Ensure that your global state solution plays well with\n   these aspects and doesn't lead to over-fetching or page bloat.\n\n * Performance: Be mindful of the size of the global state, especially when\n   using client-side state storage. Components might re-render more often, so\n   excessive global state can affect performance.\n\n\nTECHNIQUES COMPATIBLE WITH SERVER-SIDE RENDERING (SSR)\n\n * Global Objects: If you need a simple global state for things like managing\n   authentication, you can use window, but be aware of server-side concerns.\n\n * Context with getInitialProps: You can use both Context and getInitialProps to\n   initialize the service with data. This method is beneficial when you need to\n   guarantee the global state is populated before rendering on the server-side.\n\n\nTECHNIQUES FOR CLIENT-SIDE STATE ONLY\n\n * Local Storage: Use localStorage or sessionStorage if you need to persist a\n   small amount of data across page loads.\n\n * Context API with useEffect: This method allows you to initialize the context\n   using client-side effects.\n   \n   import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';\n   \n   const MyContext = createContext();\n   \n   export const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {\n     const [state, setState] = useState();\n   \n     useEffect(() => {\n       // Fetch data or restore from local storage\n       setState(initialState);\n     }, []);\n   \n     return <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>{children}</MyContext.Provider>;\n   };\n   \n   export const useMyContext = () => {\n     return useContext(MyContext);\n   };\n   \n\n * Custom Hooks: Suitable when you need more flexibility and control over\n   initializing and updating state data.\n\n * useContext in Functions and Classes: You can still use the Context API in\n   both functional and class components if needed.\n\n * State Management Libraries: While external libraries aren't in the scope of\n   this explanation, it's worth mentioning that libraries like Redux or MobX can\n   still be useful for global state management in your Next.js application.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICE\n\nWhile these client-side state management options are feasible in Next.js, it's\noften better to offload initial data requirements to server-side rendering or\ngetInitialProps to support better SEO, faster initial page loads, and an overall\nsmoother user experience.","index":40,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"42.\n\n\nWHEN SHOULD YOU CONSIDER USING A STATE MANAGEMENT LIBRARY LIKE REDUX IN A\nNEXT.JS PROJECT?","answer":"While Next.js offers built-in state management and data fetching methods, Redux\ncan be an excellent choice for more complex applications.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE NEXT.JS'S BUILT-IN STATE MANAGEMENT\n\n * For Small-Scale Apps: If your application remains relatively simple and\n   doesn't have many pages or components, Next.js's local state management\n   should suffice.\n\n * Single-Component Needs: When your application consists of standalone\n   components with no direct interlinking, local state should typically meet the\n   requirements.\n\n\nWHEN TO INTEGRATE DEDICATED STATE MANAGEMENT WITH NEXT.JS\n\n * Global State Requirements: For applications necessitating global state\n   management, where a state change in one component triggers changes across\n   others, a dedicated external library like Redux is often more effective.\n\n * Codebase Scalability: To streamline and structure data management in\n   large-scale applications, a unified global state store like Redux can make\n   code maintenance more straightforward.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR ADVANTAGES AND TRADE-OFFS\n\n * Next.js State Management Advantages:\n   \n   * Lighter in Size: Local state management doesn't require additional\n     dependencies, making it more lightweight.\n   * Quick Setup: For applications where global state isn't necessary from the\n     get-go, Next.js's built-in methods offer a rapid setup.\n\n * Next.js State Management Drawbacks:\n   \n   * Limited to Local Scope: It doesn't serve global state requirements where\n     data needs to be shared across the app or among various components.\n   * Looser Structure: Managing the state in larger applications solely based on\n     component hierarchies can lead to a complex, less organized codebase.\n\n * Redux Advantages:\n   \n   * Centralized and Predictable: With a single source of truth and clear rules\n     for state updates, data in Redux remains consistent.\n   * Time-Traveling and Undo Features: Redux DevTools provides valuable\n     debugging capabilities, including time-traveling and the ability to\n     rollback state changes.\n\n * Redux Drawbacks:\n   \n   * Added Complexity: Implementing Redux introduces extra complexity,\n     particularly apparent in smaller applications or those with limited shared\n     state needs.\n   * Learning Curve: For teams encountering Redux for the first time, there's a\n     learning curve to overcome before maximizing its potential.","index":41,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"43.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW TO PERSIST STATE BETWEEN PAGE TRANSITIONS IN A NEXT.JS APP.","answer":"Next.js, like many client-side rendering frameworks, resets the component state\non navigation, which might not always be desired.\n\nYou might want to persist certain states across page navigations for smoother\nuser experience.

Initial Project Setup: Initialize a TypeScript-enabled environment using\n     the create-next-app command with the --typescript flag. This auto-generates\n     necessary TypeScript files and configurations for the project.\n     \n     npx create-next-app my-app --typescript\n     \n\n 2.  Global .tsconfig File: If individual packages or components require a\n     different TypeScript configuration, create local tsconfig.json files for\n     each. The global .tsconfig can reference local ones.\n\n 3.  File Extension Update: Rename .js files to .ts or .tsx where appropriate.\n     .tsx is for React components with JSX, while .ts is for TypeScript files\n     without JSX.\n\n 4.  Code Analysis Using --strict: Enable strict mode with the --strict flag\n     during the migration process. This ensures type-checking and adherence to\n     best TypeScript practices.\n\n 5.  Addressing Type Errors Incrementally: Given the large surface area for\n     potential type errors in complex projects, introduce TypeScript one module\n     at a time. Use any cautiously.\n\n 6.  3rd-Party Library Considerations: Check for TypeScript support in\n     third-party libraries. While many support it natively, others might require\n     type definition installations.\n\n 7.  Type-Definition Files for Libraries: If a package lacks TypeScript support\n     or types, install @types/package-name to add declarations.\n     \n     npm install @types/node\n     \n\n 8.  Build and Test Integration: Incorporate TypeScript within the project's\n     build and test processes. Running next build and next start should also\n     validate TypeScript conformity.\n\n 9.  Consolidate JSX in .tsx Files: Migrate all React components and other files\n     with JSX to .tsx.\n\n 10. Static and Dynamic Import Differentiation: For tighter tree-shaking,\n     consider using static imports for .svg, CSS, or other file types.\n\n 11. Type Annotations Addition: Introduce type annotations in a local approach.\n     This involves starting with the any type and gradually refining it to be\n     more specific.\n\n 12. **Formidable Labs: When using@loadable/componentfrom Formidable Labs,\n     utilize the@loadable/with-loadable-components` Babel plugin for ideal\n     TypeScript integration.\n\n 13. Testing Adjustments: Update test files to conform with TypeScript, ensuring\n     that modules are imported correctly.\n\n 14. Eslint and Prettier Standardization: Integrate ESLint, Prettier, and\n     related plugins to ensure TypeScript and JavaScript code consistency within\n     the project.\n\n 15. Continual Code Review: Engage and involve other developers to review code\n     commits and maintain TypeScript conformance.\n\n 16. Monitoring the TypeScript Ecosystem: Regularly update types and watch for\n     enhancements to TypeScript.\n\n 17.

This can be\nbeneficial in scenarios where you require flexibility.\n\nFor instance, it is often practical to have separate types for visually rendered\ndata on the front end and the data served by your API routes.\n\n\nIMPERATIVE TYPE DECLARATION\n\nAn alternative way to ensure consistent typing across your application is\nthrough an imperative type declaration.\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nimport { GetServerSideProps } from \"next\";\n\n// Defining types\ntype Person = {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n};\n\ntype HomeProps = {\n  person: Person;\n};\n\n// Implicit type assignment for server-side props\nexport const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<HomeProps> = async () => {\n  const person: Person = { name: \"John\", age: 30 };\n  return { props: { person } };\n};\n\n// Function Component using defined types\nconst Home = ({ person }: HomeProps) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome, {person.name}!</h1>\n      <p>You are {person.age} years old.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n\n\nBy defining HomeProps and explicitly assigning it to getServerSideProps, you\nensure consistent typing between your server-side data and your UI component.","index":48,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"50.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE TSCONFIG.JSON FILE IN A NEXT.JS PROJECT WITH TYPESCRIPT,\nAND HOW DO YOU CUSTOMIZE IT FOR YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS?","answer":"The tsconfig.json file plays a pivotal role in TypeScript projects, including\nNext.js.\n\n\nROLE OF TSCONFIG.JSON\n\nThis configuration file:\n\n * Defines the parameters for TypeScript's behavior.\n * Specifies which files to include or exclude.\n * Manages output directory, module resolution, and source maps.\n\n\nTYPESCRIPT COMPATIBILITY WITH NEXT.JS\n\nFor optimal functioning, ensure that your tsconfig.json is set up to work\nsmoothly with Next.js.\n\nRather than starting from scratch, you can use the built-in next.config.js file\nand append specific TypeScript settings, such as:\n\n * Compiler Options: Add TypeScript settings for strict mode, module resolution,\n   and compiled code output.\n\n * Include: List the files that should be considered for compilation.\n\n * Exclude: State the directories and files that should be exempted from\n   compilation.\n\nThis makes it easier to manage advanced TypeScript configurations within Next.js\nprojects.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\"\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\", \"types/**/*\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n","index":49,"topic":" Next.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
