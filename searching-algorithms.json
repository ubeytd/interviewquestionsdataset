Comparison/Match: Compare the current element to the target. If they match,\n    you've found your element.\n 3. Iteration: Move to the next element in the list and repeat the\n    Comparison/Match step.

It investigates\nitems one by one, moving right at each step, until it either locates the target\nor surpasses it.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LINEAR SEARCH ON AN INFINITE STREAM IN PYTHON\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ndef linear_search_infinite_stream(stream, target):\n    position = 0\n    while True:\n        item = stream.next()\n        if item == target:\n            return position\n        position += 1\n\n\nNotice that 'stream' in Python does not really mean an unending supply of data\nbut is rather an illustrative concept for infinite datasets.\n\n\nBINARY SEARCH: MODIFIED FOR AN INFINITE STREAM\n\nBinary search substantially accelerates the process, but it traditionally\nrequires sorted data. Here's a way to make it suitable for unbounded or unsorted\ndatasets.\n\nRather than splitting the data in half to generate segments, define a range\naround a central point. If the target falls within that range, move ahead with\nthe segment's exploration.\n\nDestination: Provide time-cost savings in locating targets. With each iteration,\nthis approach potentially decreases the sources of data that need examination.\n\n\nALGORITHM STEPS FOR BINARY SEARCH: UNBOUNDED, POSSIBLY UNSORTED\n\nThere are five steps to follow:\n\n * Locate a Range: Discover a segment in which the target might lie. This could\n   involve, for instance, defining the initial range as starting at 0 and 1 and\n   repeatedly raising the borders until either the target surpasses the upper\n   bound or the target is within the range.\n\n * Select Medians: Numbers to represent the data are identified, such as\n   'medians.' These not only help define what's contained in the range but also\n   facilitate deeper precision on the whereabouts of the 'Target'.\n\n * Determine which Range Contains the Target: The mediator either identifies or\n   refutes this claim, and steps are then configured to investigate the likely\n   domain.\n\n * Investigate the Likely Range: Within which the 'Target' likely resides.\n\n * Return the Position: Or denote if the target turns out to be absent.\n\nDevelopers can employ distinct techniques to maintain adaptive data ranges.\nAdditionally, languages like Python provide helpful resources that mirror\nbounded data paradigms but are designed to depict unbounded or unknown-size\ndatasets when needed.\n\nFor instance, iterators can be utilized.

For sets with more elements, we can recursively construct all permutations\n    by selecting each element and finding the permutations of the remaining\n    elements.

This method\n   ensures comprehensive coverage and is especially suitable for\n   subject-specific or vertical search engines.\n   \n   BFS Algorithm\n   [https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fbreadth-first-search-min.gif?alt=media&token=4a8cc907-6b31-481d-8979-05a548976d3b]\n\n * Depth-First Search (DFS): Although less common in web crawling, DFS explores\n   websites by following a path to its deepest level before backtracking. This\n   method might have applications for efficiency but can lead to uneven coverage\n   of the web, potentially overlooking essential content.\n\nINDEXING & SERVING: INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES\n\n * Vector Space Model (VSM): VSM works on the premise that a web page can be\n   described as a vector based on the words it contains and their corresponding\n   weights. When a user query is transformed into a vector, the algorithm finds\n   the most related web pages by computing the angle between the query vector\n   and the document vectors.\n\n * Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf): This metric gauges a\n   word's significance in a document relative to its presence across all\n   documents. It identifies words that are distinct to a document, making them\n   more indicative of its content.\n\n * Boolean Model: Inspired by Boolean algebra, this model simply uses logical\n   operators like AND, OR, and NOT to sift through documents. While simpler than\n   the VSM or tf-idf, it can be less granular.\n\n * Probabilistic Retrieval: This method evaluates a query's probability of being\n   relevant to a document, using scoring to rank documents based on these\n   probabilities.\n\nDATABASE MANAGEMENT\n\nSearch engines use database management systems, such as NoSQL databases, to\nspatially store the data collected. This structured storage is crucial for rapid\nquery processing.\n\nIn summary, a well-functioning search engine interfaces with users through a\nsimple search box, but behind the scenes, it operates as a sophisticated\ninformation retrieval system powered by advanced data structures and algorithms.","index":42,"topic":" Searching Algorithms ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"44.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU FIND AN ITEM WITH MULTIPLE SEARCH CRITERIA OR CONSTRAINTS?","answer":"In real-world data processing, using only one criterion to find an item might be\ntoo restrictive.

Missing Return Statements: In the recursive calls for the function\n    recur_search, the return value of the recursive call is not propagated up.\n    This means that even if the value is found in the recursive call, the\n    function will still return false.\n    \n    Specifically, in the lines:\n    \n    recur_search(key, values, lower, mid - 1);\n    \n    \n    and\n    \n    recur_search(key, values, mid + 1, upper);\n    \n    \n    there should be a return keyword before the recur_search.\n\n 2. Potential Overflow: The calculation of the middle element:\n    \n    int mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\n    \n    \n    can lead to integer overflow if lower and upper are both large. A safer way\n    to compute the middle index would be:\n    \n    int mid = lower + (upper - lower) / 2;\n    \n\n 3. Unnecessary else Block: The condition (key > values[mid]) is implicitly true\n    by the previous conditions and does not need an explicit else block.

Tail-recursion is\n   not so common in languages like Java, Go, or Python. Most older functional\n   languages such as LISP, Scheme, Clojure, and Haskell have tail-recursive\n   function calls for recursion.\n\n * Latency and context switching: For real-time or time-sensitive applications\n   where function call overhead may be non-trivial, such as in multitasking\n   environments.\n\n * Control over stack behavior: You might choose iteration if you need to manage\n   the stack explicitly. This can be important in some multi-threading scenarios\n   or micro-controller programming.\n\n * Understood by general programmers who may not be familiar with recursion: Not\n   all programmers are comfortable with recursion, making iterative methods a\n   safer and more widely-understood option.\n\n * Readability matters more than-depth in a given software project: While some\n   algorithms are more naturally expressed recursively, others might be less\n   readable if implemented this way.\n\n * Performance: In some cases, iteration can be more efficient than recursion.\n   This is particularly true in languages or systems where function calls are\n   costly.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TAIL-RECURSIVE BINARY SEARCH\n\nHere's how the Tail-Recursive Binary Search looks like in Python.\n\ndef tail_recursive_binary_search(data, target, low, high):\n    if low > high:\n        return None\n    middle = low + (high - low) // 2\n    if data[middle] == target:\n        return middle\n    elif data[middle] > target:\n        return tail_recursive_binary_search(data, target, low, middle-1)\n    else:\n        return tail_recursive_binary_search(data, target, middle+1, high)\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWhile there are certain cases where iterative approaches have the edge, like\ntail-recursion optimization in functional languages, in practice, these\nscenarios are specific and limited.

An example of this is the Transposition Table, used in\ncombination with alpha-beta pruning to improve the performance of minimax\nalgorithms.\n\nBeyond adaptive search, several complex algorithms make use of additional data\nstructures to optimize the search.
