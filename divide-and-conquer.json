[{"text":"1.\n\n\nDEFINE DIVIDE & CONQUER ALGORITHMS AND THEIR MAIN CHARACTERISTICS.","answer":"Divide & Conquer is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking a problem\ninto smaller, more easily solvable subproblems, solving each subproblem\nindependently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.\n\nThe strategy is typically implemented with recursive algorithms, with\nwell-defined steps that make it easy to break the problem into smaller chunks\nand to reassemble the solutions into a final result.\n\n\nCORE PROCESS\n\n 1. Divide: Break the problem into smaller, more easily solvable subproblems.\n 2. Conquer: Solve these subproblems independently, typically using recursion.\n 3. Combine: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original\n    problem.\n\n\nKEY CHARACTERISTICS\n\n * Efficiency: Divide & Conquer is often more efficient than alternative\n   methods, such as the Brute-Force approach.\n * Recursiveness: The divide & conquer approach is frequently implemented\n   through recursive algorithms.\n * Subproblem Independence: Efficiency is achieved through solving subproblems\n   independently.\n * Merging: Combining subproblem solutions into a global solution, often through\n   operations like merging or addition, is a key component. This step might take\n   O(nlog⁡n)O(n\\log n)O(nlogn) or O(n)O(n)O(n) time, depending on the specific\n   problem.\n * Divide Threshold: There's typically a base case, defining the smallest\n   division to solve the problem directly instead of further dividing it, to\n   avoid infinite recursion.\n * Parallelism: Some Divide & Conquer algorithms can be efficiently\n   parallelized, making them attractive for multi-core processors and parallel\n   computing environments.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Simplicity: Choose straightforward and direct methods to solve the\n   subproblems, whenever possible.\n\n * Optimize: Aim to solve subproblems in such a way that their solutions are\n   selves used in each other's solutions as little as possible. This aids in\n   reducing overall time complexity.\n\n * Adaptation: Algorithms implementing Divide & Conquer might incorporate tweaks\n   based on the specific domain or system requirements for enhanced efficiency.\n\n\nDIVISIBILITY\n\nIn many cases, the even or uneven split of the input dataset among the\nsubproblems can be optimized for computational efficiency. Selecting the method\nthat best suits the nature of the problem can be crucial for performance. For\nexample, quicksort is generally deployed with an uneven split, while merge-sort\nuses an even one.","index":0,"topic":" Divide & Conquer ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIVIDE & CONQUER AND DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.","answer":"Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programming (DP) are both algorithmic design\nparadigms that decompose problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The\ntechniques are closely related, often characterized by overlapping features.\nHowever, they differ fundamentally at a granular level of problem decomposition,\nsolutions to subproblems, and the mechanism of subproblem reuse.\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\nPROBLEM DECOMPOSITION\n\n * Divide and Conquer: Breaks the problem into independent parts, usually\n   halves, and solves the parts individually. Examples include quicksort and\n   binary search.\n\n * Dynamic Programming: Decomposes the problem into interrelated subproblems,\n   often along a sequence or array. Solutions to larger problems are built from\n   smaller, overlapping subproblem solutions.\n\nSUBPROBLEM SOLUTIONS\n\n * Divide and Conquer: The subproblem solutions are computed independently and\n   aren't revisited or updated. This technique relies on \"no-information\n   sharing\" among subproblems.\n\n * Dynamic Programming: Subproblem solutions are computed and might be updated\n   multiple times, enabling the reusability of results across the problem space.\n\nSUBPROBLEM REUSE\n\n * Divide and Conquer: Does not explicitly focus on subproblem reuse. In\n   scenarios where subproblems are solved more than once, optimality in terms of\n   repeated computation isn't guaranteed.\n\n * Dynamic Programming: Emphasizes subproblem reuse. The algorithm's efficiency\n   and optimality stem from the repeated usage of computed subproblem solutions,\n   leading to a reduced and often polynomial running time.\n\nCONVERGENCE\n\n * Divide and Conquer: At each step, the algorithm gains progress in solving the\n   problem, usually by reducing the problem's size or scope. The solution is\n   derived once the subproblems become trivial (base cases) and are solved\n   individually.\n\n * Dynamic Programming: Progress in solving the problem is achieved through the\n   iterative resolution of overlapping subproblems, gradually building towards\n   the solution to the main problem. The solution is obtained after solving all\n   relevant subproblems.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\n\n * Divide and Conquer: Suited for problems like sorting and ordination\n   (quicksort, mergesort), list searching (binary search), and in problems where\n   subproblems are solved independently.\n\n * Dynamic Programming: Ideal for optimization problems and tasks featuring\n   overlapping subproblems, such as making change (currency), finding the most\n   efficient route (graph theory), and sequence alignment in bioinformatics.","index":1,"topic":" Divide & Conquer ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF RECURSION IN DIVIDE & CONQUER ALGORITHMS?","answer":"Divide & Conquer algorithms solve complex tasks by breaking them into easier,\nequivalent sub-problems.\n\nThis strategy can be defined through the following sequence, called the DAC\nTriad:\n\n * Divide: Decompose the problem into independent, smaller structures.\n * Abstract: Tailor a mechanism to quantify the structure's individual patterns.\n * Combine: Use partial solutions to assimilate a unified answer.\n\nThroughout this process, recursion stands as a key organizing principle, serving\ndifferent roles at each stage of the DAC Triad.","index":2,"topic":" Divide & Conquer ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE THREE MAIN STEPS IN A TYPICAL DIVIDE & CONQUER ALGORITHM?","answer":"Divide and Conquer algorithms aim to break down problems into smaller, more\nmanageable parts before solving them.
