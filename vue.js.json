[{"text":"1.\n\n\nWHAT IS VUE.JS AND WHY WOULD YOU USE IT?","answer":"Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework primarily used for building user\ninterfaces and single-page applications. It is known for its adaptability, small\nfile size, and the progressive learning curve.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nVIRTUAL DOM\n\nVue uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This\napproach significantly speeds up UI updates by only rendering what has changed.\n\nJS AND TEMPLATE INTEGRATION\n\nVue combines JavaScript and HTML-like templates for component structure. It then\nuses a virtual DOM renderer to update the actual DOM when data changes.\n\nTWO-WAY DATA BINDING\n\nVue offers two-way data binding using the v-model directive, where changes in\nthe UI instantly reflect in the data model and vice versa.\n\n\nDIRECTIVES\n\nVue leverages HTML directives for actions, loops, and more. Examples include\nv-if, v-for, and v-on.\n\n\nINTEGRATION WITH MAJOR FRONT-END TOOLS\n\nVue pairs remarkably well with a broad array of front-end tools including:\n\n * Webpack: For asset bundling.\n * Babel: To transpile ES6.\n * TypeScript: For type-safety.\n * ESLint: For code linting.\n\nLET'S LOOK AT THE VERSIONING AND THE STANCE ON BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:\n\n * Versioning Scheme: Vue adheres to Semantic Versioning, making it easier for\n   users to understand when there are breaking changes.\n\n * Backward Compatibility: While Vue places a strong emphasis on maintaining\n   backward compatibility, it might introduce breaking changes in major\n   releases. However, the Vue team assists users in the migration process,\n   providing detailed documentation and migration paths.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BIDIRECTIONAL DATA BINDING\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <input v-model=\"message\" placeholder=\"Edit me\">\n    <p>Message is: {{ message }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello Vue!'\n    }\n    }\n}\n</script>\n","index":0,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SET UP A PROJECT WITH VUE.JS?","answer":"To initialize a Vue.js project, utilize a package manager (npm or yarn) and the\nVue CLI.

Mounting: The component is being added to the DOM.\n 3. Update: Data in the component undergoes changes.\n 4. Destruction: The component is being removed from the DOM.\n\n\nLIFECYCLE HOOKS\n\n 1. beforeCreate: Occurs at the earliest step in initialization, before data\n    observations and initializations are in place.\n 2. created: After the component's data and events are set up, this hook permits\n    you to work with the component synchronously.\n 3. beforeMount: Just before the component is added to the DOM, execute logic.\n 4. mounted: The component is now in the DOM and is accessible for UI-related\n    interactions.\n 5. beforeUpdate: Before the component re-renders, you can perform certain tasks\n    here.\n 6. updated: The component has re-rendered and the DOM now reflects the most\n    recent data.\n 7. beforeDestroy: Just before the component is destroyed, carry out cleanup\n    tasks, such as uncoupling event listeners.\n 8. destroyed: Once the component is destroyed, perform any final teardown work\n    like stopping intervals or closing connections.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LIFECYCLE HOOKS\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    message: 'Hello Vue!'\n  },\n  beforeCreate: function() {\n    console.log('Before creation - The message is: ' + this.message);\n  },\n  created: function() {\n    console.log('Component created');\n  },\n  beforeMount: function() {\n    console.log('Before mounting');\n  },\n  mounted: function() {\n    console.log('Component mounted');\n  },\n  beforeUpdate: function() {\n    console.log('Before update - The message is: ' + this.message);\n  },\n  updated: function() {\n    console.log('Component updated');\n  },\n  beforeDestroy: function() {\n    console.log('Before component destruction');\n  },\n  destroyed: function() {\n    console.log('Component destroyed');\n  },\n  methods: {\n    updateMessage: function() {\n      this.message = 'Updated message';\n    },\n    destroyComponent: function() {\n      this.$destroy();\n    }\n  }\n});\n","index":2,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT ARE VUE.JS COMPONENTS AND HOW DO YOU USE THEM?","answer":"Vue.js components are reusable, self-contained elements that consist of three\nmain parts: a template, script, and style. These encapsulated building blocks\nenable a clear separation of concerns within your web application. Efficiently\nconstructed components can significantly contribute to the maintainability and\nscalability of your Vue app.\n\nIn component-based development, a larger application is broken down into\nsmaller, interconnected units—the components. Each component focuses on one\nspecific task, such as presenting the user interface for an email, a customer,\nor a form. This modular structure streamlines the development process and\nenhances code reusability.\n\n\nANATOMY OF A VUE COMPONENT\n\nHere's the step by step:\n\n1. TEMPLATE\n\nThe template is the visual representation of a component, typically constructed\nusing HTML. You can embed Vue directives, attributes, and expressions, allowing\nfor dynamic rendering based on component data and logic.\n\nEXAMPLE: VUE COMPONENT TEMPLATE\n\n<!-- vue-component.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>\n    <p v-show=\"isContentVisible\">{{ content }}</p>\n    <button @click=\"toggleContentVisibility\">Toggle Content</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n2. SCRIPT\n\nThe script provides the component's behavior and data logic. It defines the Vue\nobject options such as data, methods, computed properties, and watchers.\n\nEXAMPLE: VUE COMPONENT SCRIPT\n\n<!-- vue-component.vue -->\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      title: 'Component Title',\n      content: 'Dynamic content here!',\n      isContentVisible: true,\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    toggleContentVisibility() {\n      this.isContentVisible = !this.isContentVisible;\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n\n3. STYLE\n\nThe style section allows for component-specific CSS (or other pre-processed\nstyles like SASS or LESS) encapsulation, preventing style bleed and conflicts\nacross different parts of your application.\n\nEXAMPLE: VUE COMPONENT STYLE\n\n<!-- vue-component.vue -->\n<style scoped>\nh1 {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  color: #333;\n}\np {\n  color: darkslategray;\n  font-size: 1em;\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\nREGISTERING COMPONENTS\n\nThere are multiple ways to register Vue components:\n\n 1. Globally Registered Components: Perfect for app-wide and frequent usage.\n    Quickly added using Vue's Vue.component method.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    Vue.component('my-global-component', {\n      // Component options\n    });\n    \n\n 2. Locally Registered Components: Best for encapsulated, single-file\n    components. Import and declare in a parent component.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    import MyBaseComponent from './components/MyBaseComponent.vue';\n    \n    export default {\n      components: {\n        'my-local-base-component': MyBaseComponent,\n      },\n    };\n    \n\n 3. Automatically Imported Components: Offers on-the-fly component import. Ideal\n    for tree-shaking and smaller bundle sizes.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    async function loadGloballyRegisteredComponents() {\n      const { MyGlobalComponent } = await import('./components/MyGlobalComponent.vue');\n    }\n    \n\n 4. Component Registration via CLI or Build Tools: Benefit from Vue's build\n    tools and more streamlined workflows.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    import MyLocalComponent from './components/MyLocalComponent.vue';\n    \n    // In the build setup\n    Vue.component('my-local-component', MyLocalComponent);\n    \n\n\nPRACTICAL COMPONENT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT\n\n 1. Code Reusability: A well-designed and atomic component library ensures code\n    efficiency and reusability.\n\n 2. Collaborative Development: Parallel development and team collaboration are\n    facilitated as each team member can work on different components\n    independently.\n\n 3. Clear Code Structure: Component-based development promotes a clear,\n    self-documenting code structure, making onboarding and maintenance more\n    manageable.\n\n 4. Improved Code Quality: Smaller, isolated components are easier to test,\n    reducing the potential for bugs or unexpected behavior.\n\n 5. Enhanced Project Scalability: As your app grows, you can integrate new\n    features and scale more seamlessly with the help of components.","index":3,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU BIND DATA TO THE VIEW IN VUE.JS?","answer":"In Vue.js, Data Binding establishes a connection between the model and the view,\nensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other. Vue offers three\nprimary binding types:\n\n * One-time: Ideal for scenarios where data doesn't change, and you want to\n   initialize the view with it. Using this option can increase performance.\n * One-way: Data changes are propagated from the model to the view. It's\n   beneficial in ensuring that the model is the single source of truth,\n   simplifying the understanding of your application flow.\n * Two-way: This type of binding relationship is more dynamic, enabling changes\n   made in either the view or the model to be reflected in the opposite entity.\n\n\nDATA BINDING SYNTAX\n\n * Text: {{ }}\n * HTML Attributes: :attrName=\"dataProp\" or v-bind:attrName=\"dataProp\"\n * Element Visibility: v-show=\"condition\" or v-if=\"condition\"\n * List Rendering: v-for\n * Event Listening: @event=\"handlerMethod\" or v-on:event=\"handlerMethod\"\n\n\nKEY DIRECTIVES\n\n * v-bind: Binds data to an element.\n * v-model: Establishes two-way data binding for form inputs.\n * v-on: Listens to events on elements and triggers event handler methods\n   defined in the component.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: VUE.JS BINDING TYPES\n\nHere is the Vue data\n\ndata() {\n  return {\n    message: \"Hello, World!\",\n    isButtonDisabled: false,\n    textColor: \"red\",\n    users: [\n      { id: 1, name: \"Alice\" },\n      { id: 2, name: \"Bob\" }\n    ],\n    userProfile: {\n      id: 1,\n      name: \"Alice\",\n      email: \"alice@example.com\"\n    }\n  };\n},\nmethods: {\n  toggleButton: function() {\n    this.isButtonDisabled = !this.isButtonDisabled;\n  }\n}\n\n\nHere is the Vue HTML\n\n<p>{{ message }}</p>\n<button :disabled=\"isButtonDisabled\" @click=\"toggleButton\">Toggle</button>\n<p :style=\"{ color: textColor }\">Text in dynamic color</p>\n<ul>\n  <li v-for=\"user in users\" :key=\"user.id\">{{ user.name }}</li>\n</ul>\n<input v-model=\"userProfile.name\" type=\"text\">\n","index":4,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nWHAT IS A VUE INSTANCE AND ITS PURPOSE?","answer":"The Vue Instance serves as the entry point for Vue applications, acting as the\ncore engine that controls and coordinates the entire application.\n\n\nCORE FUNCTIONS\n\nThe Vue Instance offers key functions, including:\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT\n\n * Data: Houses the application's state, organized as key-value pairs.

Vue.js uses a differencing\nalgorithm known as Dynamic Update to match the Virtual DOM to the actual DOM,\nleading to minimal, efficient, and real-time updates.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n 1. Declarative UI: Vue.js employs declarative UI, allowing developers to state\n    \"what\" should be displayed, and abstracts the \"how\" regarding DOM updates,\n    using the Virtual DOM as a tool for efficiency.\n\n 2. Retention of State: The Virtual DOM serves as a memory bank, preserving\n    component states and rendering them to the actual DOM when necessary.\n\n 3. Batching: Vue.js strategically groups multiple DOM updates from a single\n    \"tick\" in a queue for optimum performance, regularly updating the real DOM\n    only as needed based on queue contents.\n\n 4. Performance Optimization: Through the efficient use of the Virtual DOM for\n    DOM updates, Vue.js minimizes redundant re-renders and ensures that the cost\n    of updates is proportional to the actual changes.\n\n 5. Cross-Platform Support: As both the real DOM and the Virtual DOM have\n    unified interfaces, components remain platform-independent, and developers\n    can transition between different platforms seamlessly.\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Performance: Vue.js leverages the Virtual DOM to optimize and streamline DOM\n   updates, resulting in faster user interfaces.\n\n * Ease of Use: By abstracting the complexities associated with direct DOM\n   manipulation, Vue.js empowers developers to focus on the application's logic\n   and presentation layer.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: VIRTUAL DOM\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n// Initial Array\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n// Changing Array\nnumbers[2] = 7;\n\n// Ensured updated Array\nconsole.log(numbers);  // [1, 2, 7, 4, 5]\n\n\nIn this example, even though we update an element in the numbers array directly\nwithout using any Vue.js reactivity feature, the console log still prints out\nthe modified array. This behavior stems from Vue.js reactivity and its reliance\non the Virtual DOM for enhanced efficiency.","index":6,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nWHAT ARE DIRECTIVES IN VUE.JS? CAN YOU GIVE EXAMPLES?","answer":"Vue.js directives are special attributes that manipulate the Document Object\nModel (DOM) based on the bound values.\n\nDespite closely resembling HTML attributes, directives are distinct and\nrecognized by the v- prefix, e.g., v-bind. They are fundamental for data-driven\napplications and ensure the View remains synced with the ViewModel.\n\n\nCORE DIRECTIVES\n\nV-BIND: DYNAMICALLY SETTING ATTRIBUTES\n\nThe v-bind directive syncs an HTML attribute with a Vue.js expression. This is\nespecially useful for setting dynamic classes, styles, and attributes, including\ninputs.\n\nReactive Class Example:\n\n<template>\n  <div v-bind:class=\"{ active: isActive }\"></div>\n</template>\n\n\nV-IF AND V-SHOW: CONDITIONALLY RENDERING ELEMENTS\n\nBoth of these directives control an element's visibility based on a Boolean.\n\n * v-if completely removes the element from the DOM when its attached value is\n   false.\n * v-show toggles the element's CSS display property.\n\nUse Case Distinction: Employ v-if for conditional rendering where visibility\nalterations are infrequent, while v-show is suitable for toggling visibility in\nresponse to user actions.\n\n<template>\n  <div v-if=\"isDisplayed\">Displayed on True</div>\n  <div v-show=\"isOpen\">Always Shown</div>\n</template>\n\n\nV-FOR: GENERATING REPETITIVE ELEMENTS\n\nThe v-for directive iterates over a dataset and replicates the current DOM\nelement for every item in the collection or array.\n\nDynamic List Example:\n\n<template>\n  <ul>\n    <li v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">{{ item.name }}</li>\n  </ul>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      items: [\n        { id: 1, name: 'First Item' },\n        { id: 2, name: 'Second Item' }\n      ]\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nV-ON: EVENT HANDLING\n\nThe v-on directive reacts to DOM events and triggers methods or updates data\naccordingly.\n\nEvent Handling Example:\n\n<template>\n  <button v-on:click=\"toggleState\">Toggle State</button>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      isActive: true\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    toggleState() {\n      this.isActive = !this.isActive;\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nV-MODEL: TWO-WAY DATA BINDING\n\nThis directive links form input elements to Vue.js data, ensuring that any\nchanges in the View update the underlying data and vice versa.\n\nTwo-Way Binding Example:\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" v-model=\"inputValue\" />\n  <p>{{ inputValue }}</p>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      inputValue: ''\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n","index":7,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"9.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE USER INPUTS AND FORM SUBMISSIONS IN VUE.JS?","answer":"Vue.js simplifies user interactions and form handling through its reactive\ntwo-way data binding, utility directives, and validation libraries. Let's\nexplore these features further.\n\n\nTWO-WAY DATA BINDING\n\nVue.js's two-way data binding ensures that changes in input fields are reflected\nin corresponding data properties and vice versa.\n\nFor two-way binding, use the v-model directive:\n\n<input v-model=\"name\" />\n<p>{{ name }}</p>\n\n\nIn this example, name is the corresponding data property, and its value is\nupdated as the user types in the input field.\n\n\nHANDLING EVENT\n\nVue.js provides the v-on directive to handle user-triggered events, like click,\ninput, or submit.\n\nFor example:\n\n<button v-on:click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</button>\n\n\nHere, the handleClick method is called when the button is clicked.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZE EVENT HANDLING\n\nYou can combine v-on with the .stop, .prevent, and .self modifiers to fine-tune\nevent behavior. For instance:\n\n * .stop: Prevent event propagation.\n * .prevent: Call event.preventDefault().\n * .self: Trigger only if the event initiates from the element, not its\n   children.\n\nExample:\n\n<button v-on:click.stop=\"log\">Do not propagate</button>\n\n\n\nFORM SUBMISSION\n\nTo handle form submissions and their associated actions, such as making an API\ncall, use the v-on:submit directive.\n\n<form v-on:submit.prevent=\"submitForm\">\n  <input type=\"text\" v-model=\"name\" />\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n\n\nIn this example, submitForm is triggered when the form is submitted, preventing\nthe default form action.\n\n\nASYNC FORM SUBMISSION\n\nIf your form submission involves asynchronous operations, like calling an API,\nyou can use async methods with await within v-on:submit handlers:\n\n<form v-on:submit.prevent=\"submitForm\">\n  <!-- ... form inputs ... -->\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  methods: {\n    async submitForm() {\n        // perform async operations here\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n\n\nINPUT VALIDATION WITH WATCHERS\n\nYou can ensure user inputs meet specific criteria using watchers:\n\ndata() {\n  return {\n    username: ''\n  };\n},\nwatch: {\n  username(newVal) {\n    if (newVal.length < 3) {\n      console.log('Username must be at least 3 characters long');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn this scenario, submitForm will only be called if the condition in the watch\nblock is met. If the condition fails, the submission is prevented.\n\n\nEXTENDED INPUT COMPONENTS\n\nFor form-specific needs, Vue provides dedicated components like v-radio,\nv-checkbox, and v-select:\n\n<v-form>\n    <v-radio v-model=\"gender\" :options=\"['male', 'female']\">Gender:</v-radio>\n    <v-checkbox v-model=\"agree\">I accept the terms and conditions</v-checkbox>\n    <v-checkbox v-model=\"newsletter\">Subscribe to our newsletter</v-checkbox>\n    <v-button @click=\"submit\">Submit</v-button>\n</v-form>\n\n\nEach component performs both form input submission and validation.","index":8,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"10.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE METHODS PROPERTY IN A VUE COMPONENT.","answer":"The methods Property in Vue.js lets you define and use custom methods within a\ncomponent.

They work in tandem with the Vue instance\nto monitor specific data properties, methods, or even component options.\n\n\nHOW ARE WATCHERS DEFINED?\n\nDevelopers can set up watchers in two primary ways:\n\n 1. Declared in the Watch Option\n    This option is preferred for more complex watcher functions that respond to\n    multiple data sources or need additional parameters.\n    \n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          items: [],\n          totalCount: 0\n        };\n      },\n      watch: {\n        items: {\n          deep: true,  // Detect changes at nested levels, if items are objects or arrays.\n          immediate: true, // Call the handler immediately once the component is created.\n          handler(newItems, oldItems) {\n            // Update the total count on item changes.\n            this.totalCount = newItems.length;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    };\n    \n\n 2. Using a Method to Bypass Limitations\n    By using a more conventional method, Vue developers can watch computed\n    properties, for example.

But be sure to verify\n   if the app architecture supports this behavior.\n * Reduce Unnecessary Updates: Tools like Immediate: true in watchers ensure the\n   handler is called once when the component loads, but use this option only\n   when necessary.","index":13,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU BIND INLINE STYLES IN A VUE TEMPLATE?","answer":"In Vue.js, you can bind inline styles to an element through several methods like\ntemplates with v-bind, dynamic class bindings, and JS object-style declarations.\n\n\nINLINE STYLE BINDING APPROACHES\n\n 1. Using the :style Directive: You can define an object with CSS styles and\n    then bind it to the element. Each key-value pair represents a style property\n    and its value.\n    \n    <template>\n      <div :style=\"myStyles\">Styled Text</div>\n    </template>\n    \n    <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          myStyles: {\n            color: 'blue',\n            'font-weight': 'bold',\n            fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif'\n          }\n        };\n      }\n    };\n    </script>\n    \n\n 2. Binding Inline Styles Directly: This approach is useful when the style\n    values need to be dynamic. However, it's less modular than using a style\n    object.\n    \n    <template>\n        <div :style=\"{ color: textColor, fontSize: textSize + 'px'}\">Dynamic Text</div>\n    </template>\n    \n    <script>\n    export default {\n      data() {\n        return {\n          textColor: 'green',\n          textSize: 24\n        };\n      }\n    };\n    </script>\n    \n\n 3. CSS Modules: Places styles in a separate file, processes them with Vue\n    Loader, and requires modular scoped styles in components. This approach\n    provides isolation and reusability.\n    \n    1. Create a styles.module.css file\n       \n       .styledText {\n          color: blue;\n          font-weight: bold;\n          font-family: 'Arial, sans-serif';\n       }\n       \n    \n    2. Use the CSS module in the component\n       \n       <template>\n          <div :class=\"$style.styledText\">Styled Text</div>\n       </template>\n       \n       <script>\n       export default {\n          // ...rest of the component\n       };\n       </script>\n       \n\n\nBENEFITS OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES\n\n * Code Reusability: The object approach with :style and the modular styles\n   using CSS modules are great for style management and reusability.\n * Dynamic Styling: Binding styles directly with :style and using JS objects is\n   suitable for dynamic style changes.\n * Readability and Maintainability: Each approach has its own visual language.\n   Use the one that's most readable and maintainable for your team.\n\n\nADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * Multiple Styles: Avoid grouping multiple styles under one key if you expect\n   them to change independently.\n   \n   <!-- Where feasible, avoid -->\n   <div :style=\"{color: dynamicColor, fontSize: dynamicSize + 'px'}\">\n   \n\n * Modular Styles: If you're using the object approach with :style, consider\n   managing the styles in a separate object for better readability and\n   maintainability.\n   \n   <template>\n     <div :style=\"mySeparateStylesObject\">Styled Text</div>\n   </template>\n   \n   <script>\n   export default {\n     data() {\n       return {\n         mySeparateStylesObject: {\n           color: 'blue',\n           fontSize: '22px'\n         }\n       };\n     }\n   };\n   </script>\n   ","index":14,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"16.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU PASS DATA TO A CHILD COMPONENT USING PROPS?","answer":"In Vue.js, communication between components is commonly achieved through props,\nallowing you to send data from a parent to a child component.\n\n\nSTEPS TO PASS DATA USING PROPS\n\n 1.

This can result in\ncomponents confined to unnecessary dependencies.\n\n\nAVOIDING PROP DRILLING\n\nThe technologies best known for solving Prop Drilling are Inversion of Control\nand Context API.\n\nINVERSION OF CONTROL IN VUE.JS\n\nInversion of Control, also known as IoC, involves using a centralized data\nstore, such as a global state or store. Vue.js recommends using Vuex for this\npurpose.\n\nUSING VUEX TO CENTRALIZE STATE\n\n 1. Install Vuex: Use a package manager like npm or yarn to install Vuex.\n 2. Create a Store: Set up a centralized data store, defining the state,\n    mutations, actions, and getters.\n 3. Dispatch Actions: Components can dispatch actions to the store, and data\n    flows back through mutations to update the state.\n 4. Map State and Actions: The mapState, mapActions, mapMutations, and\n    mapGetters helper functions make state and actions available in components\n    without the need for prop drilling.\n\nHere is the Vuex Store:\n\n// store.js\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport Vuex from 'vuex';\n\nVue.use(Vuex);\n\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\n  state: {\n    user: null,\n    blogPosts: [],\n  },\n  mutations: {\n    setUser(state, user) {\n      state.user = user;\n    },\n    setBlogPosts(state, posts) {\n      state.blogPosts = posts;\n    },\n  },\n  actions: {\n    fetchUser({ commit }) {\n      // Async logic to fetch user\n      commit('setUser', fetchedUser);\n    },\n    fetchBlogPosts({ commit }) {\n      // Async logic to fetch blog posts\n      commit('setBlogPosts', fetchedPosts);\n    },\n    // Other actions\n  },\n  getters: {\n    currentUser: state => state.user,\n    allBlogPosts: state => state.blogPosts,\n  },\n});\n\nexport default store;\n\n\nCONTEXT API IN VUE.JS\n\nStarting with Vue 2.4.0, a simple form of context is available through the\nprovide and inject pair. It allows a component to provide data that all its\ndescendants can inject.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <provide-key :message=\"message\">\n      <ChildComponent />\n    </provide-key>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue';\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'App',\n  components: {\n    ChildComponent,\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello from App!',\n    };\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n\nIn the example above, both App and ChildComponent can access message without\nneeding prop drilling.","index":17,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"19.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SLOTS IN VUE.JS COMPONENTS?","answer":"Vue.js components rely on slots to enable flexible markup structures and dynamic\ncontent.\n\nWhen a parent component includes one or more slot placeholders, child components\ncan insert their elements into these locations.\n\n\nSLOT TYPES\n\nDEFAULT SLOT\n\nIn a parent component, if no name is assigned to a slot, it serves as the\ndefault slot where child elements are auto-inserted.\n\nExample:\n\nParent Component Template:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <header>\n      <slot></slot>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n      <slot></slot>\n    </main>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\nHere, the header and main child elements from the parent component are inserted\ninto their corresponding sections.\n\nNAMED SLOTS\n\nComponents can specify multiple named slot placeholders. Child components can\nthen choose which slot to insert content into by referencing its name.\n\nExample:\n\nParent Component Template:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <header>\n      <slot name=\"header\"></slot>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n      <slot></slot>\n    </main>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\nChild Component Template:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <slot name=\"header\"></slot>\n    <h1>The main content!</h1>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\nThe header content from the child component is inserted into the header slot of\nthe parent component.\n\n\nSLOT SCOPE\n\nThe slot can also transfer data from the child to the parent by accepting a\nvalue and making it accessible to the parent component. This is achieved through\nthe scope attribute on the slot. Any data passes through the slot that has a\nscope attribute and is available to the parent in the slot's template.\n\nVue.js uses special syntax:\n\n * Components define slots with v-slot or the shorthand # followed by the slot\n   name. This creates a scope where you can access the passed-in data.\n * The content that's being sent to the scoped slot is determined by the parent\n   component. It's often a value or object from the parent's state or a method\n   that returns data.\n\nThis approach helps in clean code separation and makes oversized parent\ncomponents absorbable. The scope attribute must match a computed property or\ndata attribute from the child component where the slot is declared in the\ntemplate.","index":18,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"20.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE A REUSABLE COMPONENT IN VUE.JS?","answer":"Vue.js emphasizes component-based architecture, making it straightforward to\ndevelop reusable components.

In this setup, Vue ensures that the this inside your\nmethods refers to your component instance.\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</button>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n      handleClick() {\n        console.log('Button clicked!')\n      }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n\nEMITTING AND LISTENING TO CUSTOM EVENTS\n\nWhen you want to communicate between parent and child components, Vue's event\nemitter system is your best friend.\n\nFor emitting an event, use the $emit method on the child component, and to catch\nit, use the v-on directive on the parent, passing the event and a method to\nhandle it.\n\nHere we have ChildComponent.vue:\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"emitHello\">Say Hello</button>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n      emitHello() {\n          this.$emit('hello')\n      }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\nLet's take a look at ParentComponent.vue:\n\n<template>\n  <ChildComponent @hello=\"handleHello\" />\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ChildComponent\n  },\n  methods: {\n      handleHello() {\n          console.log('Hello from child component!')\n      }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n\nPASSING DATA WITH CUSTOM EVENTS\n\nSometimes you might want to send data along with your custom event. You can\nachieve this by including the data as the second argument of the $emit method.\n\nIn the child component:\n\nthis.$emit('hello', 'World!')\n\n\nIn the parent component:\n\nmethods: {\n  handleHello(data) {\n    console.log('Hello', data)\n  }\n}\n\n\nLastly, if you need to modify the data sent in the event before it's handled by\na parent or ancestor, you can utilize v-model with event modifiers.\n\n<template>\n  <ChildComponent v-model=\"data\" />\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ChildComponent\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      data: 'initial value'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\nIn ChildComponent.vue:\n\nthis.$emit('input', newData)\n","index":20,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"22.\n\n\nWHAT IS EVENT PROPAGATION AND HOW TO CONTROL IT IN VUE.JS?","answer":"In Vue.js, when an event is triggered on a particular element, it doesn't\nnecessarily stop there. Event propagation refers to the process of an event\ntraveling up and down the DOM hierarchy, potentially triggering other event\nlisteners.\n\n\nTYPES OF EVENT PROPAGATION\n\n 1. Bubbling: Starting from the element that first heard the event, the event\n    then travels up to its parents.\n 2. Capturing: Travels down from the document root through each element to the\n    target. However, Vue.js primarily employs the bubbline method. Still, you\n    can set up capturing by using addEventListener and specifying the third\n    argument as true.\n\n\nUSING EVENT MODIFIERS\n\nVue provides event modifiers to fine-tune propagation behavior. These are added\nwithin the v-on directive and come in two types:\n\n 1. Global Event Modifiers: These apply to all events.\n    \n    * .stop: Calls event.stopPropagation().\n    * .prevent: Invokes event.preventDefault().\n    * .capture: Uses the capturing mode.\n\n 2. Event-Specific Modifiers: These are tailored to specific event types.\n    \n    * .self: Extensively used with click events to ensure the target matches the\n      element that has the v-on directive.\n    * .once: The event listener gets triggered just once.\n    * .passive: Optimizes performance for certain events.\n\n\nPRACTICAL USE CASE\n\nConsider a list with items that can be clicked for selection. However, clicking\non any part of the list should close contextual menus that are active. To\nachieve this behavior, you would typically use .stop on the item's click handler\nto prevent click events from reaching the list's click handler, which in turn\nwould close contextual menus.\n\n<div v-on:click.stop=\"closeMenus\">\n  <div v-on:click=\"selectItem\">{{ item.label }}</div>\n</div>\n","index":21,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"23.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE .PREVENT AND .STOP EVENT MODIFIERS.","answer":"In Vue.js, event modifiers provide an additional layer of control, ensuring that\ncertain event characteristics are taken into account.\n\n\nDIRECTIVES FOR EVENT MODIFIERS\n\n * .prevent: Prevents the default action of an event.

These directives leverage reactivity, making\nsure UI updates when underlying data changes.\n\n\nCORE DIRECTIVES\n\nThe fundamental directives provided by Vue.js are:\n\n * v-bind: This directive binds an attribute or a component prop to an\n   expression, usually in the data or methods section. It's primarily for\n   one-way data binding, ensuring that the target reflects changes in the\n   source.\n\n * v-on: Defines an event listener for handling DOM events. It links a method to\n   an event, typically for user interaction with the page. The linked method\n   executes when the event occurs.\n\n * v-model: This directive sets up two-way binding between form inputs /\n   components and application state. It's particularly useful for forms,\n   managing data input, and feedback mechanisms.\n\n * v-for: Loops through source data, such as an array or object. This directive\n   repeats a template element (or part of it) based on iterations.\n\n * v-if, v-else-if, v-else: These three are used to carry out conditional\n   rendering based on an expression's truthiness. The structure will be visible\n   only if the linked boolean expression evaluates to true.\n\n * v-show: This toggles element visibility using CSS's display property but\n   doesn't add or remove the element from the DOM.\n\n * v-text: This directive updates the node's text content with the connected\n   value or expression.\n\n * v-html: Similar to v-text, this updates an elements' inner HTML content, but\n   it's not suitable for dynamic content from user input due to the potential\n   for XSS attacks.\n\n * v-once: Marks an element or component for one-time rendering. Once rendered,\n   it won't update even if its linked data changes.\n\n\nGLOBAL DIRECTIVES\n\nIn addition to the core set, Vue.js also grants developers access to a few\nglobal directives. While most directives are prefix-dependent ('v-'), these\ndirectives are prefix-agnostic and can be used without a 'v-' prefix:\n\n * v-for (Global)**: Gives the same functionality as the built-in v-for, but the\n   global version can loop through strings and numbers.\n\n * v-slot: This standardizes the content distribution capabilities in slots\n   across Vue components, its usage critical in complex components like Lists or\n   Dialog components.\n\n * v-pre: Prevents Vue from selectively compiling the element and its children.\n   This directive is useful for pre-formatted sections, script, or style tags\n   that Vue might otherwise target.\n\n * v-cloak: Suitable for situations with potentially sluggish component\n   initialization. It ensures the element linked with this directive remains\n   hidden until Vue has finished its setup.\n\n * v-once (Global): Similar to its core version but can be globally applied.\n\n\nCUSTOM DIRECTIVE CREATION\n\nVue's flexibility extends beyond its built-in directives, empowering developers\nto define their custom directives using the Vue.directive method.\n\nThese directives allow developers to interject custom logic at different stages\nof a directive's lifecycle, notably during initialization, component attachment,\nupdate, and destruction.\n\nThis capability is invaluable in cases where the existing directives don't\ncompletely fit the use case at hand.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR DIRECTIVE USAGE\n\nTo derive the most benefit and maintain an organized Vue.js codebase, it is\nadvisable to adhere to these best practices when working with directives:\n\n * Use Directives Sparingly: While directives are incredibly versatile, it's\n   essential to remember that Vue components and their reactive properties are\n   usually your go-to for most UI logic.\n\n * Opt for Semantic HTML: Use directives carefully, ensuring that they serve to\n   boost readability and understandability rather than cluttering the template.\n\n * Keep Templates Clean: When tempted to overload a component's template,\n   consider transferring the provisional behavior out as a feature or function\n   within a method or computed property.\n\n * Be Mindful of Directive Interference: It's necessary to steer clear of\n   situations where directives might intrude on each other, causing conflicts or\n   unexpected behavior.","index":27,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"29.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN V-BIND AND V-ON?","answer":"Vue.js offers two directives, v-bind and v-on, which play distinct roles in\nmanipulating HTML attributes and handling events.\n\n\nV-BIND: ATTRIBUTE BINDING\n\nv-bind binds HTML attributes to Vue.js data.

The parent can then\n   directly call methods or retrieve properties from the child.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    {{ count }}\n    <button @click=\"invokeChildIncrement\">Increment</button>\n    <button @click=\"invokeChildReset\">Reset</button>\n    <CounterButton ref=\"counterButton\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport CounterButton from \"./CounterButton.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data: () => ({\n    count: 0\n  }),\n  components: { CounterButton },\n  methods: {\n    invokeChildIncrement() {\n      this.count += this.$refs.counterButton.incrementCountOnce();\n    },\n    invokeChildReset() {\n      this.$refs.counterButton.resetCount();\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nThe 'CounterButton' component:\n\n<template>\n  <div></div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    incrementCountOnce() {\n      this.$data.count++;\n      return this.$data.count;\n    },\n    resetCount() {\n      this.$data.count = 0;\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n\nPROVIDE/INJECT\n\n * Dependency Injection: Share data or methods directly between components\n   without using props or events.\n\n * Example: A parent component provides the 'count' data property and the\n   'increment' method. A child component uses inject to access these provided\n   properties or methods.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    {{ count }}\n    <CounterButton />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport CounterButton from \"./CounterButton.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data: () => ({\n    count: 0\n  }),\n  provide() {\n    return {\n      getCount: () => this.count,\n      setCount: value => {\n        this.count = value;\n      }\n    };\n  },\n  components: { CounterButton }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nThe 'CounterButton' component:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"incrementCountOnce\">Increment</button>\n    <button @click=\"resetCount\">Reset</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { inject } from \"vue\";\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    incrementCountOnce() {\n      const count = inject(\"getCount\");\n      inject(\"setCount\")(count + 1);\n    },\n    resetCount() {\n      inject(\"setCount\")(0);\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n\nINSTANCE PROPERTIES\n\n * Global Object: Vue instances can maintain global data or methods.\n\n * Example: The following code defines a global Vue instance and registers a\n   'counter' type for continuous counting across components.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n// app.js\nimport Vue from \"vue\";\nexport const EventBus = new Vue();\nEventBus.counter = 0;\n\n// FirstComponent.vue\n<script>\nimport { EventBus } from \"@/app.js\";\n\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    incrementCountGlobally() {\n      EventBus.counter++;\n      console.log(EventBus.counter);\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nIn summary, while these techniques can be useful in simple use-cases, they are\ntypically not recommended for managing complex application state due to\npotential data flow issues and maintenance difficulties. For larger\napplications, it's recommended to use Vuex or consider alternative state\nmanagement libraries like Pinia or Vuestore.","index":32,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"34.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE CORE CONCEPTS OF VUEX?","answer":"Vuex acts as a centralized store for all a Vue.js application's data.

Route: A unit within the application that corresponds to a URL. It helps in\n    segregating application logic and views.\n 2. Router: The main instance that syncs the app's state with the path in the\n    URL. It provides methods and properties for route management.\n\n\nROUTE CRUD OPERATIONS\n\nROUTE CONFIGURATION\n\nThis segment is about the code required for Route Configuration.\n\nIn the App.vue file, the core Vue component, it should look like this:\n\n<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <router-view></router-view>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"App\"\n};\n</script>\n\n\nROUTE CREATION\n\nHere is the necessary code:\n\nIn the route file, generally named as \"routes.js\":\n\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport Router from 'vue-router';\nimport Home from './views/Home.vue';\nimport About from './views/About.vue';\n\nVue.use(Router);\n\nexport default new Router({\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/',\n      name: 'home',\n      component: Home\n    },\n    {\n      path: '/about',\n      name: 'about',\n      component: About\n    }\n  ]\n});\n\n\nExplanation: Here, routes for home and about URIs are defined. Once a matched\nroute is found, its associated component is rendered in the\n<router-view></router-view> of App.vue.\n\nROUTE QUERY\n\nWhen a view needs a query to determine what content to display, the 'route'\ncomponent provides utilities to grab that query for use in the view.\n\nThe query available with routes are typicaly accessed via this.$route.query in a\nVue component, or via this.$router.history.current.query outside of a component.\n\nThis is what it looks like in the code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>{{ content}}</h1>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      content: \"\"\n    };\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.content = this.$route.query.content;\n  }\n}; \n\n\n\nROUTE NAVIGATION\n\n * Imperative Navigation: Done using methods like router.push() and router.go().\n * Declarative Navigation: Achieved with Vue directives like <router-link>.\n\nHere is the code example:\n\n<router-link :to=\"{ path: '/about', query: { content: 'about us' }}\">About</router-link>\n\n\nIn the methods section of a Vue component:\n\nthis.$router.push({ path: '/about', query: { content: 'about us' } });\n\n\n\nROUTE GUARD AND MIDDLEWARE\n\nThe Router provides global and per-route navigation guards, granting control\nover route transitions. Additionally, it supports router-level beforeEach and\nafterEach hooks, great for tasks like validating user state.\n\nThis is what it looks like in the code:\n\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes\n});\n\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\n  // Check for user authentication before letting the user navigate to a route\n  const user = getCurrentUser();\n  if (!user && to.path !== '/login') {\n    next('/login');\n  }\n  next();\n});\n\nexport default router;\n\n\n\n\nROUTE MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nURL PATH RECONSTRUCTION\n\nVue Router encourages a RESTful path structure, which you might notice from the\npath properties in the route definitions, like /about, /projects/:id, and so on.\nThis aligns URL paths with patterns accepted by the server.\n\nROUTE TRANSITION\n\nPretty self-explanatory, route transitions happen whenever a URL is matched to a\nroute and the router-view directive is in place to render the appropriate\ncomponent. For instance, when the URL changes from /about to /projects/1, the\nroute is matched, and the component associated with /projects/:id is rendered.\n\nIn the Home.vue component, Vue's built-in transition component wraps the route\nview to provide a smooth transition effect.\nHere's how it looks:\n\n<template>\n  <transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\">\n    <router-view></router-view>\n  </transition>\n</template>\n\n<style>\n  .fade-enter{\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  .fade-leave-to{\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n</style>\n\n\n\nSTATE MANAGEMENT IN VUE ROUTER\n\nThe answer should include the appropriate code and the methods used to implement\nRoute Management such as Route Configuration, Route Creation, Route Query and\nRoute Navigation.\n\nHere is how state management works in Vue Router:\n\n 1. Shared State: The router has a router.app property, referencing the root Vue\n    instance. From here, you can access state properties or methods of the app,\n    or use a global event bus for communication across components.\n\n 2. Problems with Shared State: While intuitive, direct access to app's internal\n    state is discouraged, as it hinders reusability and testability.\n\n 3. Handling State Better: Modern state management libraries like Vuex are\n    recommended for more effective state management in larger applications.\n\n 4. An Alternative to Shared State: When your app is still small and Vuex feels\n    like overkill, using $route to exchange data is viable.\n    \n    * $route is reactive, so a change in the app’s route will trigger reactivity\n      in components which are referring $route properties or methods.\n\nFor instance, to provide a modal with a show property state using $route:\n\nIn Home.vue, with the modal to be toggled when the URL path is /home/day:\n\nexport default {\n  watch: {\n    '$route.path'(path) {\n      this.showModal = path === '/home/day';\n    }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      showModal: false\n    };\n  }\n};\n\n\nThen, within Home.vue's template, a <modal> component will be conditionally\ndisplayed based on showModal.\n\n<template>\n    <div>\n      <modal v-if=\"showModal\">Good day to you!</modal>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n\nBy leveraging $route, components become dynamically responsive to URL changes,\neven though there may not be parent-child relationships in the component\nhierarchy. The use of $route also helps in maintaining a clear audit trail,\nensuring relevant components always stay in sync with the URL.\n\nTest all code for correctness and a mutual relationship between each of the\nfeatures","index":35,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"37.\n\n\nDISCUSS HOW TO SET UP ROUTING IN A VUE.JS APPLICATION.","answer":"Let's take a look at the routing setup for a Vue.js Single Page Application\n(SPA) with Vue Router.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n 1. Router: Manages navigation and view transitions.\n\n 2. Route Configuration: Maps URLs to components.\n\n 3. Router-View: The area within your layout where routed components are\n    displayed.\n\n 4. Router-Link: Generates links to routes.\n\n\nINSTALLATION AND SETUP\n\nTo set up Vue Router, follow these steps:\n\n 1. Installation: Use npm or Yarn:\n    \n    npm install vue-router\n    \n\n 2. Configuration: In your Vue app, generate a router instance and link it:\n    \n    * main.js:\n    \n    import Vue from 'vue';\n    import VueRouter from 'vue-router';\n    import App from './App.vue';\n    \n    Vue.use(VueRouter);\n    \n    const routes = [/* Your route objects go here */];\n    const router = new VueRouter({ routes });\n    \n    new Vue({\n      render: h => h(App),\n      router,\n    }).$mount('#app');\n    \n\n 3. Place Router-View: In your main App.vue or layout, add\n    <router-view></router-view> where you want the app's different views to be\n    shown.\n\n 4. Define Routes: Within a dedicated route file or in main.js, create an array\n    of route configuration objects that link paths to components. For instance,\n    start with:\n    \n    const routes = [\n      { path: '/', component: Home },\n      { path: '/about', component: About },\n      // More routes\n    ];\n    \n\n 5. Define Navigation: In components or button onClick events, use router-link\n    to navigate. Example:\n    \n    <router-link to=\"/about\">About</router-link>\n    \n\n\nROUTE PROPERTIES\n\n * path: The URL path the route should match.\n * component: The Vue component to display when the path is matched. It can be\n   imported or registered globally.\n * name: A unique name that allows you to reference the route programmatically\n   or in a more human-friendly way.\n * props: Passes route parameters as props to your components.\n\n\nROUTE MATCHING\n\nEXACT MATCH\n\nIf exact is not set, the defined <router-view></router-view> in the layout will\ndisplay for any route match.\n\nROUTE WITHIN A ROUTE\n\nUse nested routes to segment components even further. To display nested routes,\nmake sure your base component (where <router-view></router-view> resides) has a\nnested <router-view> inside.\n\n\nPROGRAMMATIC NAVIGATION\n\nYou can navigate programmatically, commonly used in methods:\n\nthis.$router.push('/path');\nthis.$router.replace('/path');  // Replaces the current entry in the history\nthis.$router.go(-1);  // Goes back, accepts a history integer\n\n\n\nGUARDING ROUTES\n\nUse global and per-route guards:\n\n * Global guards: Protect all routes, useful for login checks.\n * Per-route guards: Specific to a single route.\n\nTYPES OF GUARDS\n\n * Before Route Enter: Guarding the navigation before the route is confirmed.\n * Before Route Update: Guarding a route's navigation changes without leaving\n   the component.\n * Before Route Leave: Guarding the navigation when leaving the current route.\n\nGUARDING MECHANISMS\n\nGLOBAL GUARDS\n\n * To specify a guard that should be called before the entire router moves:\n   \n   const router = new VueRouter({ /* ... */ });\n   \n   router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\n     // ...\n   });\n   \n\nPER-ROUTE GUARDS\n\n * For beforeRouteEnter, beforeRouteUpdate, and beforeRouteLeave per-route\n   guards:\n   \n   const router = new VueRouter({\n     routes: [\n       {\n         path: '/guarded-route',\n         component: GuardedComponent,\n         beforeEnter: (to, from, next) => {\n           // Check if allowed\n           next();\n         },\n       },\n     ],\n   });\n   \n\n\nLAZY LOADING ROUTES\n\nLoad only the code for the current view, reducing the code size and boot up\ntime:\n\nDYNAMICALLY IMPORTED COMPONENTS\n\nIn your routes definition, use dynamic import() to resolve a component. Here's\nan example:\n\nconst routes = [\n  {\n    path: '/lazy',\n    component: () => import('./LazyComponent.vue'),\n  },\n];\n\n\n\nHTML5 HISTORY MODE\n\nInstead of using the hash # in URLs (e.g., http://myserver.com/#/my-path), use\nhistory-based URLs:\n\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    // Your routes here\n  ],\n});\n\n\nWhen using this mode, server configuration is required to avoid potential 404\nerrors (e.g., . are direct request URIs to load your Vue app).\n\n\nBENEFITS OF VUE ROUTER\n\n * Smooth Transitions: Easily move from one view to another without page\n   reloads.\n * Declarative Nature: Define routes in a clear and organized manner.\n * State Preservation: Maintain localized view states.","index":36,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"38.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU NAVIGATE BETWEEN PAGES IN VUE.JS?","answer":"Vue.js provides a variety of ways to manage navigation between different views\nor app states through dynamic components, router links, and imperative\nnavigation.\n\n\nDYNAMIC COMPONENTS\n\nUse dynamic components along with a data property or a computed property to\ncontrol which component is rendered.\n\nEXAMPLE: DYNAMIC COMPONENT WITH TABBED NAVIGATION\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button v-for=\"(tab, index) in tabs\" :key=\"index\" @click=\"activeTab = index\">\n      {{ tab.name }}\n    </button>\n    <component :is=\"tabs[activeTab].id\"></component>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport FirstTab from './FirstTab.vue'\nimport SecondTab from './SecondTab.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      activeTab: 0,\n      tabs: [\n        { id: 'first-tab', name: 'First Tab' },\n        { id: 'second-tab', name: 'Second Tab' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  components: {\n    FirstTab,\n    SecondTab\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\nCOMPUTED PROPERTY FOR DYNAMIC COMPONENT\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button v-for=\"(tab, index) in tabs\" :key=\"index\" @click=\"activeTab = index\">\n      {{ tab.name }}\n    </button>\n    <component :is=\"activeTabComponent\"></component>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport FirstTab from './FirstTab.vue'\nimport SecondTab from './SecondTab.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      activeTab: 0,\n      tabs: [\n        { id: 'first-tab', name: 'First Tab' },\n        { id: 'second-tab', name: 'Second Tab' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    activeTabComponent() {\n      return this.tabs[this.activeTab].id;\n    }\n  },\n  components: {\n    FirstTab,\n    SecondTab\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n\nROUTER LINKS\n\nVue Router provides the router-link component for linking to different URLs and\nautomatically handling route changes.\n\nEXAMPLE: USING ROUTER-LINK\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <router-link to=\"/first-tab\">First Tab</router-link>\n    <router-link to=\"/second-tab\">Second Tab</router-link>\n\n    <router-view></router-view>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Tabs'\n}\n</script>\n\n\n\nIMPERATIVE NAVIGATION\n\nYou can programmatically control the navigation using this.$router provided by\nVue Router.\n\nEXAMPLE: THIS.$ROUTER FOR IMPERATIVE NAVIGATION\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n// Inside a Vue component method\nthis.$router.push('/path-to-navigate');\nthis.$router.replace('/path-to-navigate');\nthis.$router.go(-1);  // Go back one step\n\n\nBoth this.$router.push and this.$router.replace can also accept a Location\nobject, which gives you more flexibility.\n\n// Using 'Location' object with 'this.$router'\nthis.$router.push({ name: 'route-name', params: { id: 123 }});\n\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Choose the navigation strategy according to the app's requirements.\n * Ensure a consistent view by using a combination of strategies.\n * Incorporate user feedback mechanisms in the UI so the user is aware of the\n   navigation changes.\n * Avoid combining the strategies to keep the code organized and maintainable.","index":37,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"39.\n\n\nWHAT IS A DYNAMIC ROUTE AND HOW DO YOU CREATE ONE IN VUE ROUTER?","answer":"In Vue.js, a dynamic route adapts to varying parameters within the route path,\nsuch as user IDs or product slugs.

It lets you directly manipulate the DOM, handle events, and manage\nstate in your app.\n\nWhile Angular and Vue both customize HTML with directives, Vue's approach is\nless intrusive. Directives are opt-in in Vue, meaning developers manually\nindicate in their templates which directives to use.\n\n\nBUILDING A CUSTOM DIRECTIVE\n\nHere are the steps to create a custom directive:\n\n 1. Create the Directive Function: The directive function typically takes three\n    parameters:\n    \n    * el: the element the directive is bound to.\n    * binding: an object containing information about the binding.\n    * vnode: the virtual node (an abstract representation of the DOM node) to\n      which the el belongs.\n\nHere is the Vue.js directive Example:\n\nVue.directive('demo', {\n  bind: function (el, binding, vnode) {\n    // Do the one-time setup here\n  },\n  inserted: function (el, binding, vnode) {\n    // Do the initial setup here\n  },\n  update: function (el, binding, vnode) {\n    // Do the update\n  },\n  componentUpdated: function (el, binding, vnode) {\n    // Component has been updated (triggered after child components are updated)\n  },\n  unbind: function (el, binding, vnode) {\n    // Perform cleanup here\n  }\n})\n\n\n 2. Register the Directive Locally or Globally: You can register a directive\n    either globally for use throughout your app, or locally within a specific\n    component.\n    \n    * Global Registration: It's done using Vue.directive('directive-name',\n      directive-definition-object).\n    \n    * Local Registration: You define the directives key in a component's\n      options, listing the directives you want to use in that component.\n\n 3. Bind the Directive in the Template: Use the v-directive-name syntax to bind\n    your custom directive to a template element. For instance, a custom 'my-dir'\n    directive would look like this: <div v-my-dir=\"someValue\"></div>. The\n    someValue will be passed to the binding object in your directive function.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CUSTOM DIRECTIVE\n\nHere is the Vue.js example:\n\nFirst, import Vue and create a new directive:\n\nimport Vue from 'vue';\n\nVue.directive('focus', {\n  inserted: function(el) {\n    el.focus();\n  }\n});\n\n\nAssuming the above example:\n\n<template>\n  <input v-focus>\n</template>\n\n\nEvery time the component is rendered, the input field will be auto-focused,\nthanks to the focus directive.","index":42,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"44.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU REGISTER A GLOBAL DIRECTIVE IN VUE.JS?","answer":"In Vue.js, global directives can be registered to apply certain behaviors across\nthe entire application. This makes them particularly useful for functionalities\nlike analytics tracking, authentication, or resizing elements in a consistent\nmanner.\n\n\nSTEPS TO REGISTER A GLOBAL DIRECTIVE\n\n 1. Define the Directive Function and Register It:\n    Define the directive named example-command in a directives.js file.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    import Vue from 'vue';\n    \n    Vue.directive('example-command', {\n      // Functionality to be linked to the directive\n      inserted: function (el) {\n        el.classList.add('example-class');\n      }\n    });\n    \n\n 2. Import the Global Directive File:\n    Import the directives.js file in the main.js file of your Vue application.\n    Importing the file once ensures the directive is registered globally.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    import './directives';\n    \n\n 3. Usage in Templates:\n    The example-command directive can be used globally in any template.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    <template>\n      <div v-example-command>Hello Global Directive!</div>\n    </template>\n    \n\n 4. Vue Instance Methods and the $ Accessor:\n    Vue instances expose their own methods to manage directives. The $ accessor\n    is often used to denote Vue specific features.\n    \n    Alternate Approach:\n    \n    new Vue({\n      directives: {\n        'example-command': {\n          inserted: function (el) {\n            el.classList.add('example-class');\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    \n\n 5. Deeper Directive Insights:\n    If you want to follow how a directive got triggered, Vue gives you\n    additional directive methods like bind, inserted, update, componentUpdated,\n    and unbind.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    Vue.directive('focus', {\n      inserted: function (el) {\n        el.focus();\n      }\n    });\n    \n    \n    Using the focus directive:\n    \n    <input v-focus />\n    \n\n 6. Caution on $ Replacements in Various Versions:\n    Vue 1.x used $ to prefix directive names for everything from globes, models,\n    and events, while Vue 2.x splits these functionalities between v- and $\n    prefixes.\n    \n    Be mindful of your Vue version in selecting the right approach.","index":43,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"45.\n\n\nDISCUSS A PRACTICAL USE-CASE FOR CUSTOM DIRECTIVES.","answer":"Custom directives in Vue.js empower you to extend the framework's capabilities\nbeyond its built-in directives.

Configuration Files: Use a separate configuration file for each environment.\n    Build configurations are defined in vue.config.js.\n\nExample:\n\nFor a production build, you might have vue.prod.config.js:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  publicPath: '/production/',\n  // other production-related configurations...\n}\n\n\nFor a development build, you might have vue.dev.config.js:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  publicPath: '/development/',\n  // other development-related configurations...\n}\n\n\n 2. Process Environment Variables: Utilize environment variables accessible\n    through process.env.\n\nFor instance, specify different API endpoints for each environment:\n\nconst apiEndpoint = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https://api.example.com' : 'http://localhost:3000';\n\n\n 3. Dynamic Imports: For environment-specific components, use dynamic imports.\n\nDynamic imports allow components to be loaded on-demand.

While Vue.js inherently provides\nseveral performance optimization features, there are additional strategies to\nsolidify your app's responsiveness.\nHere are some key strategies to optimize the app:\n\n\nCORE CONCEPTS\n\nVIRTUAL DOM\n\nVue.js employs a Virtual DOM to detect changes and update the actual DOM as\nneeded, minimizing unnecessary reflows and repaints. This design simplifies the\nmanagement of complex app states.\n\nREACTIVE-DATA FLOW\n\nData reactivity is central to Vue.js. When your data changes, it triggers\nupdates throughout your application, keeping it responsive to user interactions.\n\nOPTIMIZATIONS WITH SMALLER BUNDLE SIZES\n\nUsing Build Tools like Webpack and techniques like Code-Splitting, you can\ndivide your application into smaller, more digestible bundles, reducing load\ntimes and optimizing performance.\n\n\nOPTIMIZING APPLICATION BUNDLES\n\nCODE SPLITTING\n\n * Use import() for dynamic imports or a build tool like Webpack to expedite\n   bundle loading.\n\nTREE-SHAKING\n\n * Advanced build tools like Webpack help remove redundant modules.\n\nMINIMIZE THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES\n\n * Select only essential libraries to avoid bloating your application.\n\nLAZY-LOADING ROUTES\n\n * Employ Vue's built-in Lazy-Loading feature to load routes on-demand.\n\nBUNDLE ANALYZER TOOLS\n\n * Third-party apps or build-tool plugins like webpack-bundle-analyzer visualize\n   your bundle's composition and help identify optimization potential.\n\n\nIMPROVING VUE COMPONENTS\n\nKEEP COMPONENTS LIGHTWEIGHT AND FOCUSED\n\n * Smaller, more specialized components lead to better app performance.\n\nMEMOIZATION\n\n * Use strategies such as compute properties, watchers, and functional\n   components to save and reuse results for intensive operations.\n\nVIRTUAL SCROLLING AND INFINITE LISTS\n\n * Employ third-party libraries like vue-virtual-scroller to render significant\n   lists efficiently.\n\nIMPLEMENT LIST FILTERING WITH DEBOUNCING\n\n * Utilize strategies like lodash's debouncing functionality to reduce redundant\n   filter calls on lists.\n\n\nENHANCING VUE DIRECTIVES\n\nAVOID EXCESSIVE WATCHERS\n\n * A surplus of watchers can lead to performance issues. Ensure they're limited\n   in number and necessary.\n\nAPPLY THROTTLE AND DEBOUNCE WHEN NECESSARY.\n\n * Functions like throttle and debounce are efficient in managing event\n   triggers, especially useful in tasks like autocomplete search bars or\n   scroll-based actions.\n\nSTAY MINDFUL OF INTERSECTION OBSERVERS\n\n * Instead of relying on v-scroll directives, consider using the intersection\n   observer API for optimized scroll event detection.\n\nVIRTUAL SCROLL DIRECTIVES FOR LISTS\n\n * Utilize libraries like vuesax that provide virtual scroll for list\n   components.\n\n\nOPTIMIZING HTTP CALLS WITH LIBRARIES LIKE AXIOS\n\n * Employ strategies such as caching and deduplication to minimize redundant API\n   requests.\n\n\nENHANCE APP RESPONSIVENESS\n\nSIMPLIFY TWO-WAY DATA BINDING\n\n * Minimize or avoid the use of two-way data bindings (v-model) in scenarios\n   where one-way bindings are adequate.\n\nTAME EVENT EMISSIONS\n\n * Exercises care in propagating events from child to parent components.\n   Exhaustive emission can turn inefficient.\n\n\nVUE DEVTOOLS\n\nVue DevTools is an incredible resource for diagnosing performance bottlenecks.\nAssess your app's behavior, evaluate your code's metabolism, and delineate areas\nfor refinement.\n\n\nREV UP APPLICATION STORAGE AND CACHING\n\n * Leveraging techniques like progressive web apps (PWAs) or AppCache can better\n   resource your client-side app storage.\n\n\nDYNAMIC DATA MANAGEMENT FOR DEFT QUERYING\n\nAngular and React applications might have a stronghold on the caching front, but\nVue isn't far behind.

The Cart component\nprovides the shopping cart management methods and in turn, via provide, makes\nthem available to its descendants, in this case, the ProductCatalog component.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the Cart component, which utilizes provide. The Cart\ncomponent sets up the cart and makes its methods, addItem and removeItem,\navailable to its descendants through provide.\n\n// Cart.vue\n<script setup>\nimport { provide } from 'vue';\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\nconst products = ref(props.products);\nconst addItem = (product) => {\n  const index = products.value.findIndex((p) => p === product);\n  products.value[index].inCart++;\n}\nconst removeItem = (product) => {\n  const index = products.value.findIndex((p) => p === product);\n  if (products.value[index].inCart > 0) {\n    products.value[index].inCart--;\n  }\n}\n\nprovide('cart', {\n  products,\n  addItem,\n  removeItem\n});\n</script>\n\n\nNext, let's review the child ProductCatalog component, which utilizes inject to\nmake use of the provided values from its ancestor Cart component.\n\n// ProductCatalog.vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <ul>\n      <li v-for=\"product in products\" :key=\"product.id\">\n        {{ product.name }}\n        <button @click=\"addToCart(product)\">Add to Cart</button>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\nimport { inject } from 'vue';\n\nconst cart = inject('cart');\nconst products = cart.products;\nconst addToCart = cart.addItem;\n</script>\n\n\nIn this example, the ProductCatalog component injects the cart object from its\nancestor Cart component.

It's what enables truly two-way data binding, making\nVue template directives such as {{ }} and v-model so powerful.\n\n\nCORE CONCEPTS\n\n * Data: The model that the view reacts to.\n * Directives: Predefined attributes prefixed with v- that control how data\n   within the template is manipulated.\n * Computed Properties: Provide derived state based on the reactive dependency\n   tree.\n * Watchers: Allow custom logic to be run when a reactive property changes.\n\n\nDEPENDENCY TRACKING\n\nReactivity in Vue is achieved through getters and setters of Object properties,\nfacilitated by the ES5 getter/setter syntax or ES6 Proxies.\n\n1. ES5 GETTERS/SETTERS\n\nThis approach requires defining an object's properties using\nObject.defineProperty, which sets up get and set methods.\n\nEXAMPLE: ES5 GETTERS/SETTERS\n\nlet _data = {val: 1};\nObject.defineProperty(_data, 'doubleVal', {\n  get: function() {\n    return this.val * 2;\n  },\n  set: function(newValue) {\n    this.val = newValue / 2;\n  }\n});\n\nconsole.log(_data.doubleVal); // 2\n_data.doubleVal = 6;\nconsole.log(_data.val); // 3\n\n\n2. ES6 PROXIES (MODERN APPROACH)\n\nES6 Proxies streamline reactivity with a central handler that intercepts all\noperations on the object. This method is more efficient and flexible than ES5\nsetters.\n\nEXAMPLE: ES6 PROXIES\n\nHere is a Javascript code example:\n\nlet data = { val: 1 };\nlet handler = {\n  get: function(target, key) {\n    // Track the property access\n    track(target, key);\n    return Reflect.get(target, key);\n  },\n  set: function(target, key, value) {\n    // Update the property\n    Reflect.set(target, key, value);\n    // Perform reactive updates\n    trigger(target, key);\n  }\n};\n\nlet reactiveData = new Proxy(data, handler);\n\n// Accessing the reactive property would trigger the 'get' method of the handler.\nconsole.log(reactiveData.val); // 1\n// Setting the value would trigger the 'set' method and any related reactivity.\nreactiveData.val = 2;\n\n\n\nEVENT BUS CAVEAT\n\nUsing a global Event Bus with Vue.js can circumvent the reactivity system. When\nall components directly mutate state on the event bus, Vue won't be aware of the\nchanges and won't trigger updates. This can lead to issues such as missing UI\nupdates or unexpected behavior. Instead, it's better to use Vuex, a state\nmanagement solution built explicitly for Vue applications.\n\n\nMUTATIONS AND VUEX\n\nIn a larger Vue application, especially if multiple components need to interact\nwith a shared state, it becomes necessary to manage state changes in a more\ncentralized manner.\n\nVuex introduces several core concepts for data management:\n\n * State: The single source of truth for the application's data.\n * Actions: Functions that can dispatch one or more mutations.\n * Mutations: Functions responsible for making state changes.\n\nThis pattern ensures a unidirectional data flow and makes state changes\npredictable, which fits well with Vue's reactivity system.","index":55,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"57.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU REACTIVELY ADD NEW PROPERTIES TO A VUE INSTANCE?","answer":"Let's look at how to dynamically add new properties to a Vue instance using the\nVue.set() method, which ensures that property changes are reactive.\n\n\nVUE.SET()\n\nTo make sure new properties added to an existing Vue instance are reactive, the\nmethod Vue.set(target, propertyName, value) is used.\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n * target (object or array): The object or array to which a new property is\n   being added.\n * propertyName (string or number): The name of the new property to add to the\n   target object or the index of the array element.\n * value: The value to assign to the new property.\n\nEXAMPLE: VUE.SET ON OBJECT\n\nIn this example, when a button is clicked, the new property message is added to\nthe Vue instance app, and the system's reactivity handles the display.\n\nHere is the code:\n\nHTML\n\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <button @click=\"addMessage\">Add Message</button>\n  <p>{{ message }}</p>\n</div>\n\n\nJavaScript\n\nvar app = new Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    profile: {\n      name: 'John Doe',\n      age: 30\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    addMessage: function() {\n      Vue.set(this.profile, 'message', 'Hello, Vue!');\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\n\nVUE.SET FOR ARRAYS\n\nThe Vue.set() method is also used for ensuring reactivity when modifying array\nelements.\n\nEXAMPLE: VUE.SET ON ARRAY\n\nConsider the example where an array of items is given.

This pattern allows the\nlibrary to monitor changes in the model (the data object) and automatically\nupdate the view (the HTML) when the model changes.\n\n\nMECHANISM\n\nDATA OBJECT\n\nIn Vue, the data object (or a computed property) is the source of truth for the\napplication state.\n\nGETTERS AND SETTERS\n\nWhen Vue's data object is created or updated, Vue uses JavaScript getters and\nsetters to track when a data property is accessed or modified. This enables Vue\nto capture and trigger updates whenever there's a change.\n\nTRACKING CHANGES\n\nEach component in Vue maintains a record of the data properties it uses. If a\nproperty is accessed or modified, that component is marked for an update.\n\nVIRTUAL _$ VARIABLES\n\nFor instance, if the original property is named username, Vue creates a\ncompanion property named _$username. This companion enables the tracking\nmechanism.\n\nREORDERING LISTS AND ANY ARRAY MUTATIONS\n\nVue also supplies a mechanism to track list mutations and keep the View and\nModel in sync. When the Array methods, such as push, pop, shift, unshift,\nsplice, or sort, are utilized, Vue is informed about the change and propagates\nit accordingly.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * No manual watchers: You don't manually have to oversee changes in the data\n   model and sync the view.\n * Granular control: Allows for focused, efficient updates rather than wholesale\n   re-rendering of the view.\n * Performance-centric: This approach makes Vue highly performant in its\n   reactivity.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: VUE.JS'S UTILIZATION OF OBSERVERS\n\nConsider a simple Vue component that displays a message and has a button to\nchange it:\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p>{{ message }}</p>\n    <button @click=\"changeMessage\">Change Message</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: \"Initial message\"\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    changeMessage() {\n      this.message = \"Changed message\";\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nIn this example, you declare a data object with a message property. Whenever the\nchangeMessage method is invoked, Vue automatically updates the view whenever\nthis.message changes, thanks to its observer pattern.","index":57,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"59.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE DEP CLASS IN THE VUE.JS REACTIVITY SYSTEM?","answer":"The dep class is a central component in the Vue.js reactivity system,\nresponsible for tracking dependencies. It's effectively a registry that keeps a\nrecord of data access patterns—when a reactive data object is accessed during\nthe rendering process, the associated dep is flagged, allowing Vue to detect\nchange dependencies and update components accordingly.\n\n\nCORE BUILDING BLOCKS\n\nThe dep class, along with the watcher class and reactive data sources\n(Object.defineProperty and Proxy), forms the foundation of Vue's reactivity.\n\nVue.js Reactivity Core\n[https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/vuejs%2Frole-of-dep-class-in-vuejs_rxr870.png?alt=media&token=b60a8387-d912-4790-bac8-bf7e2e3f24c8]\n\nLet's look at the functions of the dep class in more detail.\n\n\nKEY METHODS\n\n * depend(): This method acts as a subscription mechanism, allowing a watcher to\n   register itself with the dep instance. When the linked data source changes,\n   all registered watchers are notified.\n\n * notify(): When the dep instance detects a relevant change, this method is\n   triggered, alerting all its subscribing watchers to update.\n\n * addSub(watcher): As the name suggests, this method adds a watcher instance to\n   the subscription list.\n\n\nMECHANISMS FOR DATA TRACKING IN DEP\n\nThe dep class is designed to monitor reactivity using the following techniques:\n\n * Stack Maintenance: A static stack, Dep.target, is employed to keep track of\n   the current watcher under evaluation. The current watcher being looked at is\n   set whenever a watcher is created or reset during an evaluation round.\n\n * Record-Keeping Logic: Only if a watcher is present on the stack, representing\n   a currently active rendering process, is the association between the dep and\n   the watcher established.\n\n * Integrated Bookkeeping: Vue hooks into the standard processes of object or\n   array access, ensuring that dependencies are instantly acknowledged.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DEP\n\nHere is the TypeScript interface:\n\ninterface Dep {\n  id: number;\n  subs: Watcher[];\n  addSub(sub: Watcher): void;\n  depend(): void;\n  notify(): void;\n}\n\ninterface Watcher {\n  update(): any;\n}\n\n\nAnd implementing:\n\nclass DepClass implements Dep {\n  static target: Watcher | null = null;\n  id: number;\n  constructor(id: number) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.subs = [];\n  }\n  subs: Watcher[] = [];\n  addSub(sub: Watcher) {\n    this.subs.push(sub);\n  }\n  depend() {\n    if (DepClass.target) {\n      DepClass.target.addDep(this);\n    }\n  }\n  notify() {\n    this.subs.forEach(sub => sub.update());\n  }\n}\n","index":58,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"60.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU CREATE A COMPUTED SETTER IN VUE.JS?","answer":"In Vue.js, you can create a computed property with a setter to manage data\ndynamically and efficiently. This allows for a more streamlined approach to\nmanaging application state.\n\n\nCOMPUTED PROPERTY SETTERS\n\nBy establishing a two-way data binding, you can set up a computed property to\nmanage data operations, such as sorting, filtering, or transformations.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <input v-model=\"reversedMessage\" />\n    <ul>\n      <li v-for=\"word in words\" :key=\"word\">{{ word }}</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello Vue!',\n    };\n  },\n  computed: {\n    words() {\n      return this.message.split(' ');\n    },\n    reversedMessage: {\n      get() {\n        return this.message.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');\n      },\n      set(newValue) {\n        this.message = newValue.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * The reversedMessage computed property both displays and modifies the message\n   data.\n * The getter returns the reversed message, while the setter clears unwanted\n   spaces and reverses the words.\n\n\nTIPS FOR USING COMPUTED PROPERTY SETTERS\n\n * Consistency: If you need computed properties just for their setter, consider\n   using watchers or methods instead. This will enable you to steer clear of\n   potential confusion.\n * Best for UI Updates: These setters are particularly effective for immediate\n   changes in the user interface.\n * Validation and Side Effects: Both the getter and setter are perfect for\n   executing tasks such as validating input or triggering side effects.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE A METHOD INSTEAD\n\nThe dual role of getters and setters can be somewhat misleading, which is why\nit's often more effective to use methods for such tasks.\n\nGETTERS\n\n * Consistent: Getters are always available, and they're particularly beneficial\n   for computed properties where consistency is vital.\n * Modularity: If the computation is quite extensive or if you are likely to\n   reuse the outcome, get a getter over a method.\n\nSETTERS\n\n * Efficiency: Setters are not always necessary, which can simplify calls to the\n   computed property.\n * Single Responsibility: When a piece of data has a single role, a method is\n   more appropriate as it leads to clearer code.","index":59,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"61.\n\n\nDISCUSS HOW VUE.JS HANDLES TRANSITIONS.","answer":"Vue.js makes user interactions visually dynamic through transitions.

This helps maintain code readability and\nscalability. Vue.js folders follow the Segregated Layers structural concept.\n\n\nSEGREGATED LAYERS: A TOP-DOWN APPROACH\n\n * Component Files: Defined by the single-file component, each file represents\n   an element on the screen and contains the associated HTML, CSS, and\n   JavaScript logic.\n\n * Assets: This is the media and files storage area for the app. Files like\n   images, etc. will be stored here.\n\n * Test Files: This often will accompany the code written in the 'components',\n   'views', etc. folders and Unique file-to-file relationship. If I write a\n   notifications.vue component, I will create a notifications.specs.js file.\n   This helps in ensuring a consistent testing approach.\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE THE COMPONENTS FOLDER?\n\nThe Components directory contains the primary building blocks of your app:\n\n * Layout: These are atomic components that serve as the building blocks for\n   visual structures. They are usually used on multiple areas of the\n   application. Examples include Header.vue, Footer.vue, or Sidebar.vue.\n\n * Elements: This directory contains low-level reusable UI components, including\n   buttons, input fields, and so on. They are stateless (dumb) components and\n   accept props to modify behavior and appearance.\n\n * Modules: Modules, or the template blocks, bundle together groups of closely\n   interrelated components.\n\n * Partials: In contrast to Modules, Partial contains a specific component.\n\n\nWHY SEGREGATED LAYERS?\n\nThis approach provides several advantages, including:\n\n * Maintainability: Each layer has a specific function, making it easier for\n   developers to locate and work on specific parts of the codebase.\n\n * Reusability: The separation of segments like 'Modules', 'Partials', and\n   'Elements' promotes code reusability within the application and potentially\n   across projects.\n\n * Scalability: Segregated layers make it convenient to scale the project by\n   adding or modifying components with minimal disruption.\n\n * Consistency: The folder structure enforces consistency, ensuring that\n   components follow the same organizational pattern.\n\n * Testability: By associating test files directly with the components they\n   evaluate, the process of testing components becomes more manageable and\n   predictable.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: FOLDER STRUCTURE\n\nHere is the folder structure for larger Vue.js applications.\n\n/src\n  /assets\n    /images\n    /icons\n  /components\n    /elements\n      - Button.vue\n      - InputField.vue\n    /layouts\n      - AppLayout.vue\n      - AdminLayout.vue\n    /modules\n      /auth\n        - Login.vue\n        - Register.vue\n      /cart\n        - Cart.vue\n        - CartItem.vue\n    /partials\n      - Header.vue\n      - Sidebar.vue\n  /views\n    /dashboard\n      - Dashboard.vue\n      - Statistics.vue\n    /products\n      - ProductList.vue\n      - ProductDetail.vue\n  /test\n    /components\n      - AppLayout.spec.js\n","index":65,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"67.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF KEY ATTRIBUTE IN LIST RENDERING.","answer":"When populating lists with data in Vue.js, the key attribute serves two primary\nroles: efficient rendering and component state persistence.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF USING KEY ATTRIBUTE\n\n * Efficient Rendering: When elements are added, removed, or reordered, Vue uses\n   the key attribute to figure out the most optimized way to update the real\n   DOM.\n * Component State Persistence: It helps components maintain their state.

EXPRESSIONS?","answer":"Vue.js warns against using this in template expressions, focusing instead on\ndata-driven approaches.\n\n\nRATIONALE\n\nVue.js is designed to maintain a clear separation between the View and the\nViewModel:\n\n * ViewModel: Delegates data management, operations, and interactions.\n * View: Reflects the current state of the ViewModel and provides a way to\n   interact with it.\n\nBy not using this in template expressions, developers are encouraged to persist\ndata and methods in the Vue instance, thereby reinforcing this separation.\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Predictability: The Vue instance is the single source of truth for data and\n   methods, promoting code manageability.\n\n * Clarity: Promotes a clear distinction between data and markup, enhancing code\n   cognition and maintainability.\n\n * Reactivity: By encapsulating data with Vue's reactivity, changes trigger the\n   necessary updates in the view, ensuring a consistent state.\n\n * Code

<p>{{ showMessage }}</p>\n    <p>{{ logMessage() }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport MyModule from './MyModule.js';\n\nexport default {\n  mixins: [MyModule],\n  methods: {\n    logMessage() {\n      console.log(this.message);\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n * message: Directly accessed from the data option of this component.\n * showMessage: Computed property derived from message.\n * logMessage: A method which uses this.message to log message to the console.\n\n\nTEMPLATE EXPRESSION ISSUE\n\nSince the logMessage method is using this.message, it's possible that\nshowMessage won't update when message changes. This issue stems from the use of\nthis outside of the computed property where this.message is accessed.\n\nTo avoid this problem, Vue suggests using $emit to trigger events and handle\nrelated computations in the parent component.\n\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION\n\nEven though it is syntactically and grammatically correct, the complete sentence\n“The issue is by implicitly depending on this” is a bit redundant. Instead of\nwriting \"echo raining\" statements, be more thoughtful and avoid weak phrases.\n\n\nIMPROVED RECOMMENDATION (BASED ON FEEDBACK):\n\nVue.js recommends against using this in template expressions, emphasizing\ninstead a computed approach to integrate data and methods and maintain\nreactivity. By following this guideline, the distinction between data and\nmethods remains clear, ensuring both reliability and reactivity across the\napplication.","index":68,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"70.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR VUE.JS METHODS READABLE AND CONCISE?","answer":"Maintaining Vue.js methods as focused, efficient, and cohesive units of code is\nkey to a maintainable and robust Vue application.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR MANAGING METHODS\n\n 1. Avoiding Excess Functionality: Methods should serve specific tasks. Dividing\n    extensive methods into smaller, focused ones makes code more readable and\n    easier to manage.\n 2. Data Cohesion: Methods should handle and manipulate the same data. This\n    principle promotes better organization and reduces the impact of data\n    changes on the codebase.\n 3. Data Abstraction: Implement strict data hiding, allowing only the relevant\n    data and methods to be accessed. This practice centralizes the management of\n    that data, enhancing control and security.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IMPROVED METHOD MANAGEMENT\n\nHere is the code:\n\n// Bad practice: multi-responsibility method\nmethods: {\n  fetchDataAndPopulateUI: function() {\n    // Code to fetch data\n    this.data = fetchedData;\n    // Code to update UI\n    this.updateUI();\n  }\n}\n\n// Good practice: focused, single-task methods\nmethods: {\n  fetchData: function() {\n    // Code to fetch data\n    this.data = fetchedData;\n  },\n  updateUI: function() {\n    // Code to update UI\n  }\n}\n","index":69,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"71.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU WRITE UNIT TESTS FOR VUE.JS COMPONENTS?","answer":"When testing Vue.js components, you need to consider their interaction with the\nframework, such as props receipt, DOM event emission, and lifecycle hooks.\n\n\nTOOLS FOR VUE.JS TESTING\n\n 1.

Testing Asynchronous Actions: Actions may involve data fetching and other\n    asynchronous tasks. Use techniques like async/await or return/promises* to\n    handle them in your tests.\n\n 2. Isolating Unit Tests: Maintain test focus by separating action tests from\n    those of getters, mutations, and the store itself.\n\n 3. Stub and Mock Dependencies: When testing an action, you might want to avoid\n    making actual network requests or using real store functionality. Use stubs\n    or mocks instead.\n\n 4. Simulating Commit and Dispatch: Utilize mocks to verify that the action\n    correctly commits mutations or dispatches other actions.\n\n 5. Testing the Trigger of Actions: Verify that an action is appropriately\n    dispatched by another action under certain conditions.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: VUEX ACTION TEST\n\nHere is the relevant JavaScript code:\n\n 1.

A plugin is a way\nto encapsulate a set of features such as components, directives, mixins, or even\nglobal functions, making them available for use inside the Vue instance. Here is\nhow you do it, step by step:\n\n\n1. DEFINE THE PLUGIN\n\nExtend Vue directly or add global properties like methods, directives, or global\ncomponents.\n\nGLOBAL PROPERTIES\n\nComponents, directives, and filters:\n\nconst MyPlugin = {\n  install(Vue, options) {\n    // Register my-component globally\n    Vue.component('my-component', myComponent);\n\n    // Register a global directive\n    Vue.directive('my-directive', myDirective);\n\n    // Register a global filter\n    Vue.filter('my-filter', myFilter);\n  }\n};\n\n\nGLOBAL METHODS\n\nconst MyPlugin = {\n  install(Vue, options) {\n    // Add a global method or property\n    Vue.myMethod = function () {\n      // some logic\n    };\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n2. REGISTER THE PLUGIN\n\nUse Vue.use() to install the plugin whenever you create a Vue instance.\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nimport MyPlugin from './MyPlugin.js';\n\n// Use the global method to install the plugin\nVue.use(MyPlugin, options);\n\n\n\n3. IMPLEMENT VUE.USE()\n\nThis method actively uses the 'install' method of the plugin to set up the Vue\ninstance:\n\nVUE.USE()\n\n// Presumably inside your entry file\nVue.use(MyPlugin, options);\n\n\n\n4. FINAL STEPS\n\nAfter registering, both the newly registered plugin and its features are now\navailable inside the Vue instance.\n\nNotes:\n\nWhile using Webpack, ensure to export the plugin object:\n\nEXPORT AND IMPORT THE PLUGIN\n\n// MyPlugin.js\nexport default MyPlugin;\n\n\nThis allows the plugin to be imported correctly.\n\nPLUGIN DISCOVERABILITY\n\nCertain plugins can be made discoverable through the use of a default import.\n\n// DiscoverablePlugin.js\nexport default {\n  install(Vue) {\n    Vue.prototype.$example = \"Discoverable Plugin\";\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis way, when users import the plugin using the default import, the plugin's\ninstall method will be automatically called.\n\n\nCOMPLETE CODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n// plugin.js\nexport default {\n  install(Vue) {\n    // Register a global filter\n    Vue.filter('uppercase', function (value) {\n      return value.toUpperCase();\n    });\n\n    // Add a global method or property\n    Vue.myMethod = function () {\n      console.log('This is a global method');\n    };\n  }\n};\n\n\nThe plugin is then used in another file:\n\n// main.js\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport Plugin from './plugin.js';\n\nVue.use(Plugin);\n\n// And now, Vue.myMethod and the 'uppercase' filter are available globally.\n\n\nUsage:\n\n<!-- template -->\n<template>\n  <div>\n    {{ 'sample text' | uppercase }} <!-- Outputs: SAMPLE TEXT -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n","index":75,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"77.\n\n\nWHAT ARE FILTERS IN VUE.JS AND HOW DO YOU CREATE ONE?","answer":"Filters in Vue.js are functions designed to manipulate how values are displayed\nin the UI.

Let's explore key techniques and Vue.js gotcha's to be\nmindful of.\n\n\nINTEGRATION STRATEGIES\n\nGLOBAL MIXIN\n\nYou can extend Vue's beforeCreate or mounted hooks to initialize, configure, or\nclean up external libraries.\n\nVue.mixin({\n  beforeCreate() {\n    this.$dataGrid = new DataGrid();\n  }\n});\n\n\nDIRECT DOM ACCESS\n\nWhen no suitable Vue-specific API is available, direct DOM access may suffice,\nespecially for low-level DOM manipulations.\n\nconst button = document.getElementById('my-button');\nbutton.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked!'));\n\n\nWRAPPER COMPONENTS\n\nIf the library provides a UI component, consider wrapping it in a Vue component.\nYou can use $refs to access the underlying JavaScript API.\n\nExample:\n\n<template>\n  <div ref=\"slider\"></div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  mounted() {\n    this.$refs.slider.initialize();\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n\nPITFALLS TO AVOID\n\n * Vue Reactivity: Keep tasks not part of the reactive data system separate. Use\n   Vue.set for new properties on data objects.\n\n * Lifecycle Management: Manually handle lifecycle actions, especially with\n   activated and deactivated for dynamic components.\n\n * JS Framework Conflicts: When integrating multiple libraries or frameworks,\n   issues like event listener clashes may arise. Use libraries that abstract\n   such low-level tasks.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Consistency: If possible, aim to use libraries and resources from the same\n   ecosystem.\n\n * Wrapper Components: Implement clear interfaces and decouple integration\n   details where possible.\n\n * Vue Plugins: Utilize Vue plugins if they're available for smoother\n   integrations and to leverage the power of vue.config.js and customization.","index":77,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"79.\n\n\nDISCUSS HOW TO USE A VUE MIXIN GLOBALLY.","answer":"Let's look at how mixins work in Vue.js and how you can use them both globally\nand locally.\n\n\nMIXINS IN VUE.JS\n\nThink of mixins as reusable components that abstract away common functionality.\nThey are especially useful for code that is shared across multiple components. A\ntypical use case might be auxiliary functions or computed properties shared\nacross several components in an application.\n\n\nREGISTERING MIXINS GLOBALLY\n\nBy using the Vue.mixin() method, you can make a mixin globally available\nthroughout your application. This can be done wherever you create your Vue\napplication instance. This usualy happens in the main.js file.\n\nHere's an example of registering a global mixin:\n\n// main.js\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport App from './App.vue';\n\nVue.mixin({\n  methods: {\n    // Add global methods here\n  }\n});\n\nnew Vue({\n  render: h => h(App),\n}).$mount('#app');\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Accessibility: All components, including those dynamically created, have\n   access to global mixins.\n * Convenience: It centralizes common logic, eliminating the need to import and\n   apply the same mixin in every component.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Predictability: Overusing global mixins can make it harder to understand\n   component behavior, especially for developers new to the codebase.\n * Collaboration: It's essential to be careful that changes to global mixins\n   don't inadvertently affect unrelated components.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE GLOBAL VS. LOCAL MIXINS\n\n * Global Mixins: Suitable for utility functions, helper methods, or\n   functionalities needed across the whole app.\n * Local Mixins: Ideal for shared functionality among a set of closely related\n   components or building blocks within your application.\n\n\nSIDE NOTE: VUE 2 VS. VUE 3\n\nWhile the Vue.mixin() method still exists in Vue 3, using it is discouraged.\nInstead, it's best to opt for Composition API to achieve the same functionality\nin a more representative, understandable, and isolated manner. Think of the\nComposition API as Vue's native way to handle code sharing, perfectly suited for\nthe tasks once assigned to both mixin and global mixin in Vue 2.","index":78,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"80.\n\n\nWHAT ARE VUE.JS MIXINS, AND HOW DO YOU MAKE A GLOBAL MIXIN?","answer":"Mixins in Vue.js provide a way to reuse and share functions, data, and other Vue\ncomponent options across multiple components.

However, it\nshould be used with caution due to its potential for unintended consequences and\nglobal state management.\n\n\nCREATING A GLOBAL MIXIN\n\nTo create a global mixin, you'd add it in the beforeCreate lifecycle hook of the\nroot Vue instance.

Basic SPA: This model initially delivers a minimal HTML shell, which is then\n    further populated by the client.\n 2. Pre-rendered Content: The server-side Vue instance renders necessary\n    components before transmitting the complete HTML.\n 3. Middleware and Hooks: You can employ server-side middleware and Vue\n    lifecycle hooks to manipulate rendering behavior.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC SERVER-SIDE RENDERING\n\nHere is the Vue.js code:\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello, Server-rendered World!'\n    };\n  },\n  created() {\n    if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n      // This block executes on the server, and prevents client-side data re-initialization\n      this.message = 'Hello, Server-rendered World!';\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n\nADVANCED STRATEGIES AND COMPONENTS REHYDRATION\n\nIn some more complex scenarios, the client may have to take over rendering on\nspecific components.\n\n * Dynamic Rendering: Certain content might be generated dynamically based on\n   user-specific data, which won't be available on the server.\n\n * Client Takeover: The client can take control of rendering for such dynamic\n   parts, ensuring an updated, personalized experience.\n\nIn such cases, rehydration can be used to maintain component state and events\npost-server-rendering.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REHYDRATION WITH HYDRATE()\n\nHere is a JavaScript code:\n\nimport { createSSRApp, hydrate } from 'vue';\nimport App from './App.vue';\n\nconst app = createSSRApp(App);\n\n// Assuming `serverRenderedMarkup` contains the server-rendered HTML\nconst serverRenderedMarkup = fetchServerMarkup();\n\napp.use(router);\n\n// Hydrate the app with client-side reactivity\napp.mount('#app');\n\n// Hydrate the server-rendered markup\nhydrate(app, router, serverRenderedMarkup);\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n * Potential for Mismatch: Discrepancies between server-rendered HTML and\n   client-side components can occur.\n   \n   * Solution: Use hydrate() and adjust for discrepancies.\n\n * Global State Management: Centralized states might cause cross-client\n   conflicts.\n   \n   * Solution: Leverage alternatives like URL parameters or cookies.","index":81,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"83.\n\n\nWHAT IS NUXT.JS AND HOW DOES IT RELATE TO VUE.JS?","answer":"Nuxt.js is a web application framework built on top of Vue.js, offering a\nhigher-level configuration and optimized features to streamline Vue app\ndevelopment.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES OF NUXT.JS\n\n * Vue Framework: Nuxt is not a standalone framework but an extension tailored\n   for Vue with out-of-the-box advantages.\n\n * Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Nuxt designs Vue apps for server-side rendering\n   to improve SEO and initial load performance, vital for high-traffic or\n   content-heavy websites.\n\n * Code-Splitting: Nuxt apps are divided into smaller chunks, reducing initial\n   bundle sizes and parallel dependencies.\n\n * Automatic Route Generation: Based on the project structure, Nuxt infers\n   routing, eliminating the need for manual setup.\n\n * File-Based Routing: Inspired by Ember.js, Nuxt uses file system routing,\n   yielding quick and straightforward navigation.\n\n * Integrated with Vue Router and Vuex: Offering Vue Router and Vuex\n   out-of-the-box ensures streamlined state management and URI-based navigation.\n\n * Pre-Processor Capabilities: Nuxt provides CSS pre-processor support for SASS,\n   LESS, and Stylus.\n\n * Meta-Tags and Seo: Offers built-in functionalities for setting up meta-tags\n   for pages, which is required for SEO best-practices.\n\n * Nuxt-Modules: A modular system in Nuxt for sharing reusable configurations,\n   libraries or functionalities with other developers.\n\n\nWHEN TO CHOOSE NUXT.JS\n\n * SEO-Critical Web Developments: For projects where search engine visibility is\n   paramount, Nuxt's SSR optimization is a game-changer.\n\n * Performance-Oriented Applications: Especially for apps targeting low-end\n   devices or markets with slower networks, Nuxt's benefits in reduced load\n   times and efficient routing are invaluable.\n\n * Developer Resource Efficiency: Nuxt's opinionated structure and automatic\n   features alleviate common development decisions, cutting down on wasted time\n   and effort.\n\n\nVISUAL REPRESENTATION OF NUXT.JS VS.

Here are the core components of the process:\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\nVUE ROUTER\n\nVue Router is responsible for route-based code-splitting. It's achieved using\ndynamic imports, enabling more compact bundles for each route.\n\nVUE META\n\nVue Meta is used for managing metadata like titles, descriptions, or even custom\ntags such as Open Graph or Twitter Cards. The data is extracted and used during\nthe static generation process.\n\nSERVER-SIDE RENDERING MIDDLEWARE\n\nFor SSR on dynamic routes, Vue Router syncs with the server using the\nbeforeResolve hook. This makes sure that all data is prefetched before rendering\nthe page. Vue Store can be used to cache this data during the server-side\nrender.\n\nBUILD SETUP\n\nThe key to the static site generator is the way the project is built. A specific\nbuild mode, targeting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is used, which benefits from\nautomatic code-splitting.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BUILD SCRIPT WITH NODE.JS\n\nHere is the Node.js code:\n\n// buildStatic.js\nconst { createBundleRenderer } = require('vue-server-renderer');\nconst express = require('express');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst serverBundle = require('./dist/vue-ssr-server-bundle.json');\nconst clientManifest = require('./dist/vue-ssr-client-manifest.json');\n\nconst app = express();\n\nconst renderer = createBundleRenderer(serverBundle, {\n  runInNewContext: false,\n  template: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, './index.html'), 'utf-8'),\n  clientManifest\n});\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));\n\napp.get('*', (req, res) => {\n  renderer.renderToStream({ url: req.url }).pipe(res);\n});\n\napp.listen(8080);\n\n\n\nHOSTING FOR A VUE.JS STATIC SITE\n\nHosting a statically generated Vue.js site is swift and straightforward, often\nrequiring only the use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve global\navailability and site performance.\n\nDEPLOYMENT OPTIONS\n\n * Netlify: Netlify can integrate directly with your Git repository, providing\n   continuous deployment. As soon as you push your static website changes, they\n   are automatically deployed globally.\n\n * Vercel: Vercel also provides a seamless deployment process. As you push your\n   changes to your Git repository, Vercel automatically triggers the deployment\n   of your website.\n\nSELF-HOSTED OPTION\n\nIf you prefer self-hosting, you can use a variety of web servers:\n\n * Nginx: Nginx is an open-source web server known for its performance,\n   stability, rich features, and simple configuration.\n\n * Apache HTTP Server: Apache is one of the oldest and most commonly used web\n   servers. It provides numerous features and is often an ideal choice for\n   traditional hosting.\n\nBoth Nginx and Apache can serve your static files with minimal configuration.","index":83,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"85.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE AUTHENTICATION IN A VUE.JS APPLICATION?","answer":"Vue.js simplifies the process of authentication by offering several core\nlibraries and versatile platforms.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Vue Router: Manages navigation and ensures that unauthorized users are\n   redirected to the login page.\n\n * Vuex: Serves as the central store for user information post-login.\n\n * HTTP Library or Instance: Carries out API requests and appends the user's\n   access token where necessary.\n\n\nPHASES OF AUTHENTICATION\n\n 1. Registration and Login: Users create accounts or sign in, after which their\n    access tokens are obtained.\n\n 2. Authorization: Ensures users have the correct permissions to access certain\n    parts of the app.\n\n 3. Logout: Destroys their access tokens for a secure exit.\n\n 4. State Persistence: Allows users to remain logged in across app restarts or\n    refreshing the page.\n\n\nVUE ROUTER SETUP\n\nIn router.js, use navigation guards for route protection:\n\nimport router from 'vue-router';\n\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\n  // Determine if the route requires authentication\n  const requiresAuth = to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth);\n  \n  if (requiresAuth && !userIsAuthenticated()) {\n    // Redirect to the login page if not authenticated\n    next('/login');\n    return;\n  }\n  next();\n});\n\n\n\nVUEX STORAGE FOR USER DATA\n\nIn store.js, manage user data:\n\nimport Vuex from 'vuex';\n\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\n  state: {\n    user: null,\n  },\n  mutations: {\n    setUser(state, user) {\n      state.user = user;\n    },\n    clearUser(state) {\n      state.user = null;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nThis data flow prevents direct access and manipulation of user data, maintaining\na single source of truth.\n\nHTTP LIBRARY INTEGRATION\n\nThe process of incorporating an HTTP library, such as Axios, starts with setting\nup interception for token-injection:\n\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\naxios.interceptors.request.use(config => {\n  const token = store.state.user?.token;\n  if (token) {\n    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;\n  }\n  return config;\n});\n\n\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE STATE MANAGEMENT\n\nState management transcends login status and includes other user-related\ninformation.

Template: HTML that defines the component's structure.\n\n 2. Script: JavaScript for the component, including the actual Vue object or\n    class.\n\n 3. Style: CSS for component.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF SFCS\n\n * Readability and Maintainability: All pertinent information is in one file,\n   establishing a clear, centralized point of reference for a component's\n   behavior and appearance.\n\n * Scoped Styles: Styles are auto-scoped to the component, avoiding global bleed\n   and making encapsulation effortless.\n\n * Functional Cohesion: The three key ingredients of a component—view, logic,\n   and style—are collocated, enhancing understandability and permitting better\n   teamwork.\n\n * Consistent Naming: The file name, script tag, and component declaration are\n   typically the same, promoting consistency.\n\n\nUSING PREPROCESSORS WITH SFCS\n\nSFCs integrate smoothly with preprocessor languages for CSS (like LESS or SASS)\nas well as HTML (Pug, formerly known as Jade). Simply configure your tooling to\nsupport these file types.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC SFC\n\nHere is the code:\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"my-component\">\n    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>\n    <button @click=\"incrementCount\">Click Me</button>\n    <div>{{ count }}</div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      title: 'Hello, SFC!',\n      count: 0\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    incrementCount() {\n      this.count++;\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n.my-component {\n  background-color: lightgray;\n}\n</style>\n","index":85,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"87.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE STRUCTURE OF A SINGLE FILE COMPONENT.","answer":"The Single File Component (SFC) in Vue.js merges HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\nwithin one file to create modular and independent components. Below are the\ncontents and structure of an SFC.\n\n\nANATOMY OF A SINGLE FILE COMPONENT\n\nA typical .vue file comprises three primary sections: <template>, <script>, and\n<style>, which respectively handle the HTML template, JavaScript logic, and CSS\nstyling.\n\nSTARTING A SINGLE FILE COMPONENT\n\nWhen initializing a new .vue file, it is recommended to begin with a <template>\nblock and a <script> block. The <style> block is optional.\n\n<template>\n  <!-- Your HTML template here -->\n</template>\n\n<script>\n// Your JavaScript logic here\n</script>\n\n<!-- Optional: CSS styles -->\n<style>\n  /* Your CSS here */\n</style>\n\n\nJAVASCRIPT BLOCK: HANDLING DATA AND METHODS\n\nThe <script> block accommodates JavaScript code for the component, including:\n\n * export default: This is where the Vue instance, or options object, is\n   defined. It exports the object making up the component, intended to be\n   imported and registered by a Vue instance or another component. It can also\n   contain named exports.\n\n * props: Describes expected props if the component is to consume them.\n\n * data: Returns an object that acts as the component's data. The object should\n   include the initial values.\n\n * methods: Defines the methods that the component can use, with each method\n   being a function within the object.\n\n * computed: Lists computed properties for the component. These are properties\n   whose values are derived dynamically based on one or more other properties.\n\n * watch: This is where watchers can be defined.\n\n * Lifecycle Hooks: Define hook functions to execute tasks at specific stages in\n   the component's lifecycle.\n\nexport default {\n  props: { ... },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      /* Initialize data here */\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    /* Component methods */\n  },\n  computed: {\n    /* Computed properties */\n  },\n  watch: {\n    /* Property to watch: Handler method */\n  },\n  created() {\n    /* Code to run on component creation */\n  }\n};\n\n\nTEMPLATE BLOCK: HTML STRUCTURE AND VUE DIRECTIVES\n\nThe <template> block contains the HTML template for the component. It can use\nVue directives and Vue data/state:\n\n * v-bind: For two-way data binding between HTML attributes and properties in\n   the application state.\n\n * v-on: To attach event listeners to HTML elements.\n\n * v-if, v-else: Conditional rendering.\n\n * v-for: Loops through an array to render multiple elements.\n\n * v-model: Provides two-way data binding on form input elements like <input>,\n   <textarea>, etc.\n\n * {{ }}: Double curly braces to display data from the state within the HTML\n   template.\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>\n    <input v-model=\"inputValue\" />\n    <button @click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</button>\n    <div v-if=\"showDiv\">I'm here</div>\n    <ul>\n      <li v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">{{ item.text }}</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\nSTYLE BLOCK: SCOPED CSS\n\nThe <style> block can contain CSS for the component.

Each method has its unique\ncharacteristics, best practices, and use-cases 111.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\n\nOPTIONS API\n\nThe Options API structures components using objects, with lifecycle hooks,\ncomponent methods, and component data all housed separately in the data,\nmethods, and lifecycle segments. This approach is familiar and useful for small\nto moderate projects or for developers transitioning from other frameworks to\nVue. It offers benefits such as:\n\n * Clear Segmentation: Components separate data, lifecycle hooks, and methods,\n   enhancing readability.\n\n * Queryable Structure: Editors that support jump-to-definition can help\n   navigate different sections like data and methods.\n\nCOMPOSITION API\n\nIntroduced in Vue.js 3, the Composition API is centered around building\ncomponents using functions. It organizes the functionalities usually divided by\nOptions API properties into composition functions.\n\nThis design is particularly useful for more massive, real-world applications and\nfor composing or refactoring complex logic. The API's standout features include:\n\n * Clean, Compact Definitions: Code is typically more concise, as functionality\n   is defined in context and without the declarative overhead of \"methods\" or\n   \"computed\" properties.\n\n * Contextual Scope: Each section is relatively self-contained, leading to\n   better code locality in larger files or utility modules.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: OPTIONS API VS. COMPOSITION API\n\nHere is the Options API:\n\n<template>\n  <div>{{ message }}</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello from Options API!',\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    updateMessage() {\n      this.message += ' Updated!';\n    },\n  },\n  created() {\n    console.log('Component created!');\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n\nNow, here is the equivalent using the Composition API:\n\n<template>\n  <div>{{ message }}</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const message = ref('Hello from Composition API');\n    \n    const updateMessage = () => {\n      message.value += ' Updated!';\n    };\n\n    onMounted(() => {\n      console.log('Component mounted!');\n    });\n\n    return {\n      message,\n      updateMessage,\n    };\n  },\n};\n</script>\n","index":91,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"93.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE NEW REACTIVITY SYSTEM INTRODUCED IN VUE.JS 3.","answer":"In Vue.js 3, the reactivity system has been enhanced for improved performance,\npredictability, and extensibility.\n\n\nKEY EVOLUTIONS\n\n 1.

These updates\noptimize performance, streamline debugging, and leverage the capabilities of\nmodern JavaScript.\n\n\nKEY CHANGES IN VUE.JS 3 VDOM\n\n1. COMPOSITION API\n\nIn Vue.js 2, apps primarily use the \"Options API\" where options for a component\nare declared in an options object.\n\nIn Vue.js 3, you can supplement or even replace the options object by building\nfunction-based components using the Composition API, effectively allowing a more\nmodular approach.\n\n2. ASYNC UTILITIES\n\nVue.js provides async non-blocking methods like nextTick and $nextTick to update\nthe Virtual DOM asynchronously making operations more efficient.\n\n3. DIRECTIVES AND LIFECYCLE HOOKS\n\nIn Vue.js 3, custom directives and lifecycle hooks provide more control as they\noperate on individual DOM nodes rather than the entire tree.\n\nFor example, the beforeMount hook is invoked right before the associated\ncomponent is mounted to the DOM. In comparison, the mounted hook is triggered\nonce the directive's component is mounted.\n\n4. SETUP FUNCTIONS OVER DATA OPTIONS\n\nIn Vue.js 2, data options are configured within the data object or using a data\nfunction to establish the initial state for each instance of a component.\n\nVue.js 3, however, integrates a setup function to ease state management and data\nhandling, enhancing development efficiency.\n\n5. SLOTS UNIFICATION\n\nVue.js 3 standardizes slot-related terminologies, promoting consistent slot use\nacross component versions. The v-slot directive, for instance, harmonizes slot\nhandling in both the v-slot and the slot counterpart.\n\n6. PURE VIRTUAL COMPONENTS\n\nVue.js 3 enhances reactivity and efficiency by optimizing out unnecessary render\ncycles for components without state or lifecycle hooks.\n\nDefined as pure virtual components, they enable performance gains by avoiding\nsuperfluous render operations.\n\n\nIMPACT OF VDOM CHANGES\n\nENHANCED MODULARITY\n\nThe Composition API enhances code organization, making it easier to understand,\ntest, and maintain specific features.\n\nINSULATION OF COMPONENTS\n\nDirectives' focus on individual DOM nodes provides a higher level of component\nencapsulation, improving code cohesion and readability.\n\nCONSISTENCY ACROSS VERSIONS\n\nUnified slot directives ensure consistent slot interaction, making it easier to\nadapt existing components to Vue.js 3.\n\nEFFICIENT RESOURCE UTILIZATION\n\nFacilities like pure virtual components maximize app performance and limit\nresource consumption.\n\nENHANCED LIFECYCLE CONTROL\n\nA more fine-grained directive lifecycle empowers developers with flexible,\ngranular control over component behavior.\n\nSTREAMLINED ASYNCHRONOUS UPDATES\n\nThe updated Version 3's asynchronous methods synchronize UI updates for improved\nefficiency, ensuring only necessary operations are performed.","index":93,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"95.\n\n\nWHAT IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE SLOTS SYNTAX IN VUE.JS 3?","answer":"In Vue.js 3, the slot semantics have been significantly streamlined, resulting\nin a more intuitive approach for managing parent-child component relationships.\n\n\nKEY SYNTAX IMPROVEMENTS\n\n * Dynamic Slot Names: Rather than relying solely on static names, Vue.js 3\n   allows you to use both variables and methods to define slot names\n   dynamically.\n\n * Scoped Slots as Functions: In the latest version, scoped slots are\n   represented as functions. This design enables the transfer of context, thus\n   ensuring better component communication.\n\n * Unrestricted Slot Propagation: The updated slot mechanism no longer inherits\n   properties automatically. Instead, it enables more deliberate data transfer,\n   mainly for enhanced reactivity.\n\n\nSYNTAX COMPARISON: VUE 2 VS.

As a\nresult, changes in a component's state do not auto-reflect in its parent or\nsibling. This optimized reactivity model, called Reactivity Batching,\ncontributes to better performance.

This technique\nleverages Webpack's code-splitting capabilities.\n\nAfter ensuring the required setup, you can proceed with the following steps:\n\n\nSTEPS TO SET UP LAZY LOADING WITH VUE.JS\n\n 1. Install Lazy Loading Support: It typically involves adding Webpack's dynamic\n    import feature.\n\n 2. Update Component Imports: Replace the usual import statements with dynamic\n    import() calls.\n\n 3. Define the Route: In the route configuration, use the component key to\n    specify the path to the component file. Vue Router is aware that this path\n    corresponds to a module that should be dynamically imported.\n\n 4. Create Development and Production Configurations: Depending on the\n    deployment environment, you can configure how components are loaded. For\n    instance, in development, it's often preferable to load all components\n    instantly, without lazy loading, to facilitate rapid iterations.\n\n 5. Verify Setup: Ensure that your components are loading lazily as expected. A\n    browser's network panel can be helpful in confirming that a component is\n    fetched only when necessary.\n\n 6. Explore Beyond Routes: Besides routes, you can make use of lazy loading in\n    various scenarios. These include asynchronous components, conditional\n    rendering, and more.\n\n 7.

To\nmitigate these challenges, you can optimize your routing strategy using\ndifferent techniques: Bundled Routing, Lazy Loading, and Nested Routing.\n\n\nBUNDLED ROUTING\n\nTraditional routing injects all views into a single bundle (e.g., app.bundle.js)\nwhich can lead to longer initial loading times. In contrast, bundled routing\nsplits view components into separate bundles, enabling them to load on demand.\n\nPRACTICAL APPROACH:\n\nIn the vue-router setup, use import to divide routes into separate modules.\nThen, configure Webpack or Parcel to create distinct bundles for each route:\n\nCode Example: Route Divisions\n\n// Use import in route definitions\nconst Dashboard = () => import('./components/Dashboard.vue');\nconst About = () => import('./components/About.vue');\n\n\nWebpack - Configure 'output' Property in webpack.config.js:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.[name].js',\n  },\n};\n\n\nParcel - Utilize --no-source-maps Flag to Avoid Duplicate Module Loading:\n\nparcel build src/index.html --no-source-maps\n\n\n\nLAZY LOADING\n\nWith lazy loading, Vue.js defers the loading of non-essential resources until\nthey are required, enhancing initial page load times. This is particularly\nbeneficial for applications featuring several routes or views that users may not\nfrequently visit.\n\nPRACTICAL APPROACH:\n\nIn your Vue components, use import() for conditional loading and implement\ndynamic imports:\n\nCode Example: Dynamic Imports\n\n// Use import() in your component\nconst About = () => import('./components/About.vue');\n\n\n\nNESTED ROUTING\n\nIn complex Vue applications, organizing routes in a hierarchical structure\nmirrors your view composition. This makes management more intuitive and\nconvenient, especially when specific groups of routes are tightly integrated or\nif they share a common layout or navigation.\n\nPRACTICAL APPROACH:\n\nIn your top-level route configuration, specify nested routes to maintain a\nhierarchical organization:\n\nCode Example: Nested Routes\n\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/dashboard',\n      component: DashboardLayout,\n      children: [\n        // child routes\n        {\n          path: 'projects',\n          component: ProjectsView,\n        },\n        {\n          path: 'tasks',\n          component: TasksView,\n          children: [\n            // nested children\n            {\n              path: ':id',\n              component: TaskDetail,\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n});\n","index":98,"topic":" Vue.js ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"100.\n\n\nHOW DO STYLE AND ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS IMPACT THE SCALABILITY OF VUE.JS\nAPPLICATIONS?","answer":"Preferably, when designing a Vue.js application, segment it into manageable,\nself-contained building blocks called components.
