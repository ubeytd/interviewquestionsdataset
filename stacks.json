This is the most common\n   notation for humans due to its intuitiveness.\n   \n   Example: 1+2 1 + 2 1+2\n\n * Prefix: Operators are placed before operands.

Let's take a look\nat how this process works.\n\n\nTHE CALL STACK\n\nThe call stack maintains a record of all the active function calls that a\nprogram makes. When a new function is called, it's added to the top of the\nstack. Once a function finishes its execution, it's removed from the stack, and\ncontrol returns to the calling function.\n\nThis \"last in, first out\" behavior is well-suited to stack data structures.\n\n\nHOW THE CALL STACK WORKS\n\n 1. Function Call: When a function is called, a stack frame is created and\n    pushed onto the call stack. This frame contains important information about\n    the state of the function, such as local variables and the return address,\n    which points to the instruction after the function call.\n\n 2. Local Execution: The CPU executes the instructions within the called\n    function. The function accesses its inputs, processes data, and calls other\n    functions as needed.\n\n 3. Return: If the called function doesn't make any further function calls, it\n    exits, and its stack frame is removed. Alternatively, if the function makes\n    additional calls, the call stack grows further.\n\n 4. Stack Unwinding: Once the initial (or other topmost) function call is\n    finished, there are no more functions to execute. The stack then shrinks,\n    starting with the top frame, until it's empty.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING THE CALL STACK\n\nHere is code written in Python:\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    result = a * b\n    return result\n\ndef calculate(a, b, c):\n    temp = multiply(b, c)\n    return a + temp\n\nresult = calculate(2, 3, 4)\nprint(result)  # Output: 14\n\n\nIn this example, when calculate is called, it first calls multiply and then\nperforms addition. The call stack looks like this during the execution of\ncalculate:\n\n 1. calculate with parameters (2, 3, 4)\n 2. multiply with parameters (3, 4)\n\nOnce multiply completes, its stack frame is removed, and calculate continues\nwith the next line of code.\n\n\nBENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF CALL STACK\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Automatic Memory Management: The call stack automatically allocates memory\n   for local variables and function parameters, simplifying memory management\n   for developers.\n * Efficiency: Its simple structure makes it efficient for managing function\n   calls in most programming scenarios.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\n * Size Limitations: The stack has a fixed memory size allocated at program\n   startup, which can lead to stack overflow errors if the stack grows too\n   large.\n * No Random Access: Elements in the stack can only be accessed or removed in a\n   last-in-first-out manner, limiting its use in some algorithms and data\n   structures.","index":5,"topic":" Stacks ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nDESCRIBE AN APPLICATION WHERE STACKS ARE NATURALLY SUITED OVER OTHER DATA\nSTRUCTURES.","answer":"Stacks find natural utility in various practical use-cases, such as in text\neditors for tracking actions and providing the \"undo\" and \"redo\"\nfunctionalities.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: UNDO AND REDO STACK\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nclass UndoRedoStack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._undo_stack = []\n        self._redo_stack = []\n\n    def push(self, action):\n        self._undo_stack.append(action)\n        # When a new action is pushed, the redo stack needs to be reset\n        self._redo_stack = []\n\n    def undo(self):\n        if self._undo_stack:\n            action = self._undo_stack.pop()\n            self._redo_stack.append(action)\n            return action\n\n    def redo(self):\n        if self._redo_stack:\n            action = self._redo_stack.pop()\n            self._undo_stack.append(action)\n            return action\n\n\n\nSTACK-BASED UNDO AND REDO WORKFLOW\n\nIn a typical text editor, the user can:\n\n * Type Text: Each time new text is entered, it represents an action that can be\n   undone or redone.\n * Perform Undo/Redo: The editor navigates through previous actions, whether to\n   reverse or reinstate them.","index":6,"topic":" Stacks ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nCOMPARE ARRAY-BASED VS LINKED LIST STACK IMPLEMENTATIONS.","answer":"Array-based stacks excel in time efficiency and direct element access.

While a thread\nholds the lock, other threads are blocked from entering critical sections.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nimport threading\n\nclass LockedStack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stack = []\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()\n\n    def push(self, item):\n        with self.lock:\n            self.stack.append(item)\n\n    def pop(self):\n        with self.lock:\n            if self.stack:\n                return self.stack.pop()\n            return None\n\n\n\nNON-BLOCKING MECHANISM\n\nThis approach uses atomic operations on primitive data types, which are\nguaranteed to happen without interruption.\n\nHere is the Python code for this approach:\n\nimport queue\nimport threading\n\ndef non_blocking_push(q, item):\n    while True:\n        old_q = q.queue\n        new_q = old_q.copy()\n        new_q.append(item)\n\n        if q.queue == old_q:\n            q.queue = new_q\n            return\n  \t  \ndef non_blocking_pop(q):\n    while True:\n        old_q = q.queue\n        new_q = old_q.copy()\n        if q.queue:\n            new_q.pop()\n            if q.queue == old_q:\n                q.queue = new_q\n                return q.queue[-1] \n    return None\n  \t  \nq = queue.LifoQueue()\n\nthreading.Thread(target=non_blocking_push, args=(q, 1)).start()\nthreading.Thread(target=non_blocking_push, args=(q, 2)).start()\nthreading.Thread(target=non_blocking_pop, args=(q,)).start()\n\n\nFor the Multi-threaded Setup, you can run this Python code:\n\n\nDATA STRUCTURE SELECTION\n\nSome container classes, like the LifoQueue in Python, are inherently designed to\nbe thread-safe, thus making their contents and operations secure in a\nmulti-threaded environment.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nimport queue\nimport threading\n\nq = queue.LifoQueue()\n\nq.put(1)\nq.put(2)\nprint(q.get())\nprint(q.get())\n","index":11,"topic":" Stacks ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"13.\n\n\nIMPLEMENT A STACK WITH A FIND-MIDDLE OPERATION IN O(1) TIME.","answer":"PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nThe task is to design a stack data structure that supports push, pop,\nfindMiddle, and deleteMiddle operations, all in constant O(1) O(1) O(1) time\ncomplexity.\n\n\nSOLUTION\n\nWe can solve this challenge using a doubly linked list where each node also\nincludes a pointer to the middle node.

Here are several strategies you can\nuse to achieve this:\n\n\nTECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING LOCALITY OF REFERENCE\n\n 1. Consistent Stack Frames: Keep stack frame sizes somewhat uniform. This\n    minimizes the chances of a cache line straddling two frames, which could\n    lead to unnecessary data fetching.\n\n 2. Limited Stack Size: If the stack size is known upfront, you can reduce the\n    likelihood of cache thrashing (as the stack is too big for cache to handle\n    all at once) by keeping the stack size smaller than the cache size, if\n    possible. However, this approach is not always practical in real-world\n    applications.\n\n 3. Buddy Memory Allocation: Dividing stack memory into fixed-size segments, or\n    \"buddies\", ensures that each frame is a multiple of that size. This type of\n    memory management can improve cache performance.\n\n 4. Circular Stacks: Instead of growing the stack linearly, you can manage the\n    space in a circular manner. Allocations and deallocations are then based on\n    modulo operations, effectively \"wrapping\" the stack.\n\n 5. Multi-level Stacks: Here, the stack memory is divided into multiple smaller\n    stacks. The primary stack is used for general storage, and when a large\n    activation record (or certain types of data) is pushed, a smaller stack is\n    allocated specifically for that data.\n\n 6. Memory Pooling: In this strategy, memory is pre-allocated and managed using\n    a smart allocator for specific types of objects. For instance, a pool for\n    small, fixed-size objects could improve cache performance.\n\n 7. Thread-Specific Caches: In environments where multiple threads share the\n    same cache, you can assign each thread a specific cache for its stack. This\n    ensures that stack data accessed by a particular thread is kept separate,\n    reducing cache contention and improving cache coherency.\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS ACROSS LANGUAGES\n\n * C/C++: These low-level languages offer more control over memory management,\n   making it easier to implement some of these strategies. For example, in C++,\n   you could use thread-local storage to allocate a cache-efficient stack for\n   each thread.\n\n * Java: Java abstracts a lot of memory management details, but with certain\n   libraries like JEMalloc, it's possible to fine-tune memory allocation, and to\n   some extent, cache behavior.\n\n * Python: Python, being a high-level and dynamically-typed language, has its\n   memory management handled by the interpreter. However, you can often improve\n   cache performance indirectly with code optimizations and specialized\n   libraries for critical areas. Techniques like memory pooling can be favorable\n   in these settings.\n\n * Rust: Rust offers fine-grained control over memory management and has support\n   for compiler optimizations. This makes it easier to implement custom memory\n   management strategies for improving cache performance. Rust's ownership\n   system compels many stack-like allocations and deallocations at compile time,\n   further improving cache efficiency.","index":36,"topic":" Stacks ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"38.\n\n\nDESCRIBE A LOCK-FREE STACK AND WHERE IT MAY BE USED.","answer":"A lock-free stack offers an efficient alternative to traditional stacks,\nespecially in situations requiring high concurrency or in systems that are\nsensitive to potential lock-related delays.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES\n\n * Atomicity: Lock-free stacks ensure individual operations are atomic, making\n   it possible for multiple threads to execute them concurrently.\n\n * Compare-and-Swap (CAS): This operation is fundamental to lock-free\n   algorithms. It checks if a value is still the same before updating it,\n   essentially 'claiming' the update if no other thread has modified it in the\n   meantime. If the value has changed, the operation is retried.\n\n * ABA Problem: Though less common, this issue can arise in lock-free stacks\n   when a value is replaced, and then the same value is re-inserted. Strategies\n   like tagging or using double-width CAS can mitigate the ABA problem.\n\n\nCOMMON PATTERNS AND BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Optimism: Lock-free mechanisms are built on the philosophy that most of the\n   time, threads won't interfere with each other. If conflicts occur, they are\n   resolved as needed.\n\n * Error Rate: Some potential blockages, like ABA issues, might be seen as\n   occasional, acceptable errors rather than full-scale problems.\n\n * Retry Loops: Many lock-free algorithms, including the lock-free stack, are\n   designed to use retry loops when CAS operations fail.

The\ntechnique essentially doesn't grow the stack, allowing potentially infinite\nrecursion with constant stack usage.\n\nIn this technique, a called function can modify a number of its local variables\nbefore initiating the tail call.

However, not all languages\nare designed to optimize tail calls, and some implementations might not be\ncomplete.\n\nWhile these techniques can be especially beneficial in memory-constrained\nenvironments, it's essential to ensure compatibility with your target platforms\nand evaluate resource constraints beforehand.","index":42,"topic":" Stacks ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"44.\n\n\nCREATE AN ALGORITHM TO NORMALIZE PATHNAMES USING A STACK.","answer":"PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nGiven an absolute path, the goal is to convert it to its shortest form.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n * Input: \"/usr/lib/../bin/gcc\"\n * Output: \"/usr/bin/gcc\"\n\nOther valid transformations: \"/usr/gcc\", \"/usr/bin/gcc\", \"/gcc\"\n\n\nSOLUTION\n\nWe will utilize a stack-based algorithm, which is efficient and easy to\nimplement.\n\nALGORITHM STEPS\n\n 1.
