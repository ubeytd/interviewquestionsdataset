It is the primary language\nfor tasks like data retrieval, data manipulation, and database administration.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n * DDL (Data Definition Language): Used for defining and modifying the structure\n   of the database.\n * DML (Data Manipulation Language): Deals with adding, modifying, and removing\n   data in the database.\n * DCL (Data Control Language): Manages the permissions and access rights of the\n   database.\n * TCL (Transaction Control Language): Governs the transactional management of\n   the database, such as commits or rollbacks.\n\n\nCOMMON DATABASE MANAGEMENT TASKS\n\nData Retrieval and Reporting: Retrieve and analyze data, generate reports, and\nbuild dashboards.\n\nData Manipulation: Insert, update, or delete records from tables. Powerful\nfeatures like Joins and Subqueries enable complex operations.\n\nData Integrity: Ensure data conform to predefined rules. Techniques like foreign\nkeys, constraints, and triggers help maintain the integrity of the data.\n\nData Security: Manage user access permissions and roles.\n\nData Consistency: Enforce ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,\nDurability) in database transactions.\n\nData Backups and Recovery: Perform database backups and ensure data is\nrestorable in case of loss.\n\nData Normalization: Design databases for efficient storage and reduce data\nredundancy.\n\nIndices and Performance Tuning: Optimize queries for faster data retrieval.\n\nReplication and Sharding: Advanced techniques for distributed systems.\n\n\nBASIC SQL COMMANDS\n\n * CREATE DATABASE: Used to create a new database.\n * CREATE TABLE: Defines a new table.\n * INSERT INTO: Adds a new record into a table.\n * SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n * UPDATE: Modifies existing records.\n * DELETE: Removes records from a table.\n * ALTER TABLE: Modifies an existing table (e.g., adds a new column, renames an\n   existing column, etc.).\n * DROP TABLE: Deletes a table (along with its data) from the database.\n * INDEX: Adds an index to a table for better performance.\n * VIEW: Creates a virtual table that can be used for data retrieval.\n * TRIGGER: Triggers a specified action when a database event occurs.\n * PROCEDURE and FUNCTION: Store database logic for reuse and to simplify\n   complex operations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC SQL QUERIES\n\nHere is the SQL code:\n\n-- Create a database\nCREATE DATABASE Company;\n\n-- Use Company database\nUSE Company;\n\n-- Create tables\nCREATE TABLE Department (\n    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    DeptName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Employee (\n    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    EmpName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    EmpDeptID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (EmpDeptID) REFERENCES Department(DeptID)\n);\n\n-- Insert data\nINSERT INTO Department (DeptName) VALUES ('Engineering');\nINSERT INTO Department (DeptName) VALUES ('Sales');\n\nINSERT INTO Employee (EmpName, EmpDeptID) VALUES ('John Doe', 1);\nINSERT INTO Employee (EmpName, EmpDeptID) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 2);\n\n-- Select data from database\nSELECT * FROM Department;\nSELECT * FROM Employee;\n\n-- Perform an inner join to combine data from two tables\nSELECT Employee.EmpID, Employee.EmpName, Department.DeptName\nFROM Employee\nJOIN Department ON Employee.EmpDeptID = Department.DeptID;\n","index":0,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SQL AND NOSQL DATABASES.","answer":"SQL and NoSQL databases offer different paradigms, each designed to suit various\ntypes of data and data handling.\n\n\nTOP-LEVEL DIFFERENCES\n\n * SQL: Primarily designed for structured (structured, semi-structured) data —\n   data conforming to a predefined schema.\n\n * NoSQL: Suited for unstructured or semi-structured data that evolves\n   gradually, thereby supporting flexible schemas.\n\n * SQL: Employs SQL (Structured Query Language) for data modification and\n   retrieval.\n\n * NoSQL: Offers various APIs (like the document and key-value store interfaces)\n   for data operations; the use of structured query languages can vary across\n   different NoSQL implementations.\n\n * SQL: Often provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n   compliance to ensure data integrity.\n\n * NoSQL: Databases are oftentimes optimized for high performance and horizontal\n   scalability, with potential trade-offs in consistency.\n\n\nCOMMON NOSQL DATABASE TYPES\n\nDOCUMENT STORES\n\n * Example: MongoDB, Couchbase\n * Key Features: Each record is a self-contained document, typically formatted\n   as JSON. Relationship between documents is established through embedded\n   documents or references.\n   Example: Users and their blog posts could be encapsulated within a single\n   document or linked via document references.\n\nKEY-VALUE STORES\n\n * Example: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB\n * Key Features: Data is stored as a collection of unique keys and their\n   corresponding values. No inherent structure or schema is enforced, providing\n   flexibility in data content.\n   Example: Shopping cart items keyed by a user's ID.\n\nWIDE-COLUMN STORES (COLUMN FAMILIES)\n\n * Example: Apache Cassandra, HBase\n * Key Features: Data is grouped into column families, akin to tables in\n   traditional databases. Each column family can possess a distinct set of\n   columns, granting a high degree of schema flexibility.\n   Example: User profiles, where certain users might have additional or unique\n   attributes.\n\nGRAPH DATABASES\n\n * Example: Neo4j, JanusGraph\n * Key Features: Tailored for data with complex relationships. Data entities are\n   represented as nodes, and relationships between them are visualized as edges.\n   Example: A social media platform could ensure efficient friend connections\n   management.\n\n\nDATA MODELING DIFFERENCES\n\n * SQL: Normalization is employed to minimize data redundancies and update\n   anomalies.\n * NoSQL: Data is often denormalized, packaging entities together to minimize\n   the need for multiple queries.\n\n\nAUTO-INCREMENTING IDS\n\n * SQL: Often, each entry is assigned a unique auto-incrementing ID.\n * NoSQL: The generation of unique IDs can be driven by external systems or even\n   specific to individual documents within a collection.\n\n\nHANDLING DATA RELATIONSHIPS\n\n * SQL: Relationships between different tables are established using keys (e.g.,\n   primary, foreign).\n * NoSQL: Relationships are handled either through embedded documents,\n   referencing techniques, or as graph-like structures in dedicated graph\n   databases.\n\n\nTRANSACTION SUPPORT\n\n * SQL: Transactions (a series of operations that execute as a single unit) are\n   standard.\n * NoSQL: The concept and features of transactions can be more varied based on\n   the specific NoSQL implementation.\n\n\nDATA CONSISTENCY LEVELS\n\n * SQL: Traditionally ensures strong consistency across the database to maintain\n   data integrity.\n * NoSQL: Offers various consistency models, ranging from strong consistency to\n   eventual consistency. This flexibility enables performance optimizations in\n   distributed environments.\n\n\nSCALABILITY\n\n * SQL: Typically scales vertically, i.e., by upgrading hardware.\n * NoSQL: Is often designed to scale horizontally, using commodity hardware\n   across distributed systems.\n\n\nDATA FLEXIBILITY\n\n * SQL: Enforces a predefined, rigid schema, making it challenging to\n   accommodate evolving data structures.\n * NoSQL: Supports dynamic, ad-hoc schema updates for maximum flexibility.\n\n\nDATA INTEGRITY & VALIDATION\n\n * SQL: Often relies on constraints and strict data types to ensure data\n   integrity and validity.\n * NoSQL: Places greater emphasis on the application layer to manage data\n   integrity and validation.","index":1,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SQL COMMANDS?","answer":"SQL commands fall into four primary categories: Data Query Language (DQL), Data\nDefinition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control\nLanguage (DCL).\n\n\nDATA QUERY LANGUAGE (DQL)\n\nThese commands focus on querying data within tables.\n\nKEYWORDS AND EXAMPLES:\n\n * SELECT: Retrieve data.\n * FROM: Identify the source table.\n * WHERE: Apply filtering conditions.\n * GROUP BY: Group results based on specified fields.\n * HAVING: Establish qualifying conditions for grouped data.\n * ORDER BY: Arrange data based on one or more fields.\n * LIMIT: Specify result count (sometimes replaces SELECT TOP for certain\n   databases).\n * JOIN: Bring together related data from multiple tables.\n\n\nDATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL)\n\nDDL commands are for managing the structure of the database, including tables\nand constraints.\n\nKEYWORDS AND EXAMPLES:\n\n * CREATE TABLE: Generate new tables.\n * ALTER TABLE: Modify existing tables.\n   * ADD, DROP: Incorporate or remove elements like columns, constraints, or\n     properties.\n * CREATE INDEX: Establish indexes to improve query performance.\n * DROP INDEX: Remove existing indexes.\n * TRUNCATE TABLE: Delete all rows from a table, but the table structure remains\n   intact.\n * DROP TABLE: Delete tables from the database.\n\n\nDATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML)\n\nThese commands are useful for handling data within tables.\n\nKEYWORDS AND EXAMPLES:\n\n * INSERT INTO: Add new rows of data.\n   * SELECT: Copy data from another table or tables.\n * UPDATE: Modify existing data in a table.\n * DELETE: Remove rows of data from a table.\n\n\nDATA CONTROL LANGUAGE (DCL)\n\nDCL is all about managing the access and permissions to database objects.\n\nKEYWORDS AND EXAMPLES:\n\n * GRANT: Assign permission to specified users or roles for specific database\n   objects.\n * REVOKE: Withdraw or remove these permissions previously granted.","index":2,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE SELECT STATEMENT.","answer":"The SELECT statement in SQL is fundamental to data retrieval and manipulation\nwithin relational databases.

Each record is a mix of customer and invoice information. This can\nlead to data redundancy and anomalies.\n\nFIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF)\n\nTo reach 1NF, ensure all cells are atomic, meaning they hold single values. Make\nseparate tables for related groups of data. In our example, let's separate\ncustomer details from invoices and address multiple items on a single invoice.\n\nCUSTOMER DETAILS TABLE\n\nID Name\n\nINVOICES TABLE\n\nInvoice No. Customer_ID Invoice Date\n\nITEMS TABLE\n\nInvoice No. Item No. Description Quantity Unit Price\n\nNow, each table focuses on specific data, unique to 1NF.\n\n1NF is crucial for efficient database operations, especially for tasks like\nreporting and maintenance.\n\nSECOND NORMAL FORM (2NF)\n\nTo achieve 2NF, consider the context of a complete data entry. Each non-key\ncolumn should be dependent on the whole primary key.\n\nIn our example, the Items table already satisfies 2NF, as all non-key columns,\nlike Description and Unit Price, depend on the entire primary key, formed by\nInvoice No. and Item No. together.\n\nTHIRD NORMAL FORM (3NF)\n\nFor 3NF compliance, there should be no transitive dependencies. Non-key columns\nshould rely only on the primary key.\n\nThe Invoices table requires further refinement:\n\nUPDATED INVOICES TABLE\n\nInvoice No. Customer_ID Invoice Date\n\nHere, Customer_ID is the sole attribute associated with the customer.\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\n\n * Higher normal forms provide stronger data integrity but might be harder to\n   maintain during regular data operations.\n * Consider your specific application needs when determining the target normal\n   form.\n\n\nREAL-WORLD USAGE\n\n * Many databases aim for 3NF.\n * In scenarios requiring exhaustive data integrity, 4NF, and sometimes beyond,\n   are appropriate.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IMPLEMENTING 3NF\n\nHere is the SQL code:\n\n-- Create Customer and Invoices Table\nCREATE TABLE Customers (\n    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Name VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Invoices (\n    InvoiceNo INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Customer_ID INT,\n    InvoiceDate DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (Customer_ID) REFERENCES Customers(ID)\n);\n\n-- Create Items Table\nCREATE TABLE Items (\n    InvoiceNo INT,\n    ItemNo INT,\n    Description VARCHAR(100),\n    Quantity INT,\n    UnitPrice DECIMAL(10,2),\n    PRIMARY KEY (InvoiceNo, ItemNo),\n    FOREIGN KEY (InvoiceNo) REFERENCES Invoices(InvoiceNo)\n);\n\n\nThis code demonstrates the specified 3NF structure with distinct tables for\nCustomer, Invoices, and Items, ensuring data integrity during operations.","index":9,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"11.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE CONCEPT OF DENORMALIZATION AND WHEN YOU WOULD USE IT.","answer":"Denormalization involves optimizing database performance by reducing redundancy\nat the cost of some data integrity.\n\n\nCOMMON TECHNIQUES FOR DENORMALIZATION\n\n 1. Flattening Relationships:\n    \n    * Combining related tables to minimize joins.\n    * Example: Order and Product tables are merged, eliminating the many-to-many\n      relationship.\n\n 2. Aggregating Data:\n    \n    * Precomputing derived values to minimize costly calculations.\n    * Example: a Sales_Total column in an Order table.\n\n 3. Adding Additional Redundant Data:\n    \n    * Replicating data from one table in another to reduce the need for joins.\n    * Example: The Customer and Sales tables can both have a Country column,\n      even though the country is indirectly linked through the Customer table.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * Reporting and Analytics:\n   \n   * Companies often need to run complex reports that span numerous tables.\n   * Denormalization can flatten these tables, making the reporting process more\n     efficient.\n\n * High-Volume Transaction Systems:\n   \n   * In systems where data consistency can be relaxed momentarily,\n     denormalization can speed up operations.\n   * It's commonly seen in e-commerce sites where a brief delay in updating the\n     sales figures might be acceptable for faster checkouts and improved user\n     experience.\n\n * Read-Mostly Applications:\n   \n   * Systems that are heavy on data reads and relatively light on writes can\n     benefit from denormalization.\n\n * Search- and Query-Intensive Applications:\n   \n   * For example, search engines often store data in a denormalized format to\n     enhance retrieval speed.\n\n * Partitioning Data:\n   \n   * In distributed systems like Hadoop or NoSQL databases, data is often stored\n     redundantly across multiple nodes for enhanced performance.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS AND TRADE-OFFS\n\n * Performance vs. Consistency:\n   \n   * Denormalization can boost performance but at the expense of data\n     consistency.\n\n * Maintenance Challenges:\n   \n   * Redundant data must be managed consistently, which can pose challenges.\n\n * Operational Simplicity:\n   \n   * Sometimes, having a simple, denormalized structure can outweigh the\n     benefits of granularity and normalization.\n\n * Query Flexibility:\n   \n   * A normalized structure can be more flexible for ad-hoc queries and schema\n     changes.

They can perform various tasks, such as filtering and aggregate\ncomputations. Subqueries can also be useful for complex join conditions,\nself-joins, and more.\n\n\nCOMMON SUBQUERY TYPES\n\nSCALAR SUBQUERY\n\nA Scalar Subquery returns a single value. They're frequently used for\ncomparisons—like >, =, or IN.\n\nExamples:\n\n * Getting the maximum value:\n   \n   * SELECT col1 FROM table1 WHERE col1 = (SELECT MAX(col1) FROM table1);\n\n * Checking existence:\n   \n   * SELECT col1, col2 FROM table1 WHERE col1 = (SELECT col1 FROM table2 WHERE\n     condition);\n\n * Using aggregates:\n   \n   * SELECT col1 FROM table1 WHERE col1 = (SELECT SUM(col2) FROM table2);\n\nTABLE SUBQUERY\n\nA Table Subquery is like a temporary table. It returns rows and columns and can\nbe treated as a regular table for further processing.\n\nExamples:\n\n * Filtering data:\n   \n   * SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 IN (SELECT col1 FROM table2 WHERE\n     condition);\n\n * Data deduplication:\n   \n   * SELECT DISTINCT col1 FROM table1 WHERE condition1 AND col1 IN (SELECT col1\n     FROM table2 WHERE condition2);\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF USING SUBQUERIES\n\n * Simplicity: They offer cleaner syntax, especially for complex queries.\n\n * Structured Data: Subqueries can ensure that intermediate data is properly\n   processed, making them ideal for multi-step tasks.\n\n * Reduced Code Duplication: By encapsulating certain logic within a subquery,\n   you can avoid repetitive code.\n\n * Dynamic Filtering: The data returned by a subquery can dynamically influence\n   the scope of the outer query.\n\n * Milestone Calculations: For long and complex queries, subqueries can provide\n   clarity and help break down the logic into manageable parts.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS AND OPTIMIZATION\n\n * Performance: Subqueries can sometimes be less efficient. Advanced databases\n   like Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL offer optimizations, but it's\n   essential to monitor query performance.\n\n * Versatility: While subqueries are powerful, they can be less flexible in some\n   scenarios compared to other advanced features like Common Table Expressions\n   (CTEs) and Window Functions.\n\n * Understanding and Debugging: Nested logic might make a stored procedure or\n   more advanced techniques like CTEs easier to follow and troubleshoot.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING SUBQUERIES\n\nHere is the SQL code:\n\n-- Assuming you have table1 and table2\n\n-- Scalar Subquery Example\nSELECT col1 \nFROM table1 \nWHERE col1 = (SELECT MAX(col1) FROM table1);\n\n-- Table Subquery Example\nSELECT col1, col2 \nFROM table1 \nWHERE col1 = (SELECT col1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);\n","index":13,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ORDER BY CLAUSE.","answer":"The ORDER BY clause in SQL serves to sort the result set based on specified\ncolumns, in either ascending (ASC, default) or descending (DESC) order.

For multiple columns, the order of precedence is from left to\n   right.\n * ASC and DESC Directives: These allow for both ascending and descending\n   sorting. If neither is specified, it defaults to ascending.\n\n\nUSE CASES\n\n * Top-N Queries: Selecting a specific number of top or bottom records can be\n   accomplished using ORDER BY along with LIMIT or OFFSET.\n\n * Trends Identification: With ORDER BY, you can identify trends or patterns in\n   your data, such as ranking by sales volume or time-based sequences.\n\n * Improved Data Presentation: By sorting records in a logical order, you can\n   enhance the visual appeal and comprehension of your data representations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ORDER BY MULTIPLE COLUMNS AND LIMIT RESULTS\n\nLet's say you have a \"sales\" table with columns product_name, sale_date, and\nunits_sold. You want to fetch the top 3 products that sold the most units on a\nspecific date, sorted by units sold (in descending order) and product name (in\nascending order).\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\nSELECT product_name, sale_date, units_sold\nFROM sales\nWHERE sale_date = '2022-01-15'\nORDER BY units_sold DESC, product_name ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n\n\nThe expected result will show the top 3 products with the highest units sold on\nthe given date. If two products have the same number of units sold, they will be\nsorted in alphabetical order by their names.\n\n\nSQL SERVER SPECIFIC: ORDER BY COLUMN POSITION\n\nIn SQL Server, you can also use the column position in the ORDER BY clause. For\nexample, instead of using column names, you can use 1 for the first column, 2\nfor the second, and so on. This syntax:\n\nSELECT product_name, sale_date, units_sold\nFROM sales\nWHERE sale_date = '2022-01-15'\nORDER BY 3 DESC, 1 ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n\n\nperforms the same operation as the previous example.\n\n\nMYSQL SPECIFIC: RANDOM ORDER\n\nIn MySQL, you can reorder the results in a random sequence. This can be useful,\nfor instance, in a quiz app to randomize the order of questions.

This means that without any further WHERE clause, it\napplies the join-predicate to each pair of rows without any filtering.\n\nWhile such joins can be computationally expensive, they do have specialized\nuse-cases, such as when you need to compare every row from one table with every\nrow from another.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING CROSS JOIN\n\nHere is the SQL code:\n\nSELECT * FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2;\n\n\n\nTYPICAL SCENARIOS\n\n * Data Exploration: When you're first exploring and understanding the\n   relationships between tables.\n * Data Aggregation: For operations like creating subtotals or totals in data,\n   or calculating percentages and running totals.\n * Performance Testing: Determining the extreme performance boundary of a join\n   process or the server's capability.\n\n\nADVANCED CONSIDERATIONS\n\nOPTIMIZATION WITH WHERE CLAUSE\n\nWhile cross joins join every row from one table with every row from another, you\ncan add a WHERE clause to limit the number of rows returned. This is typically\nseen in percentage calculations where you might cross join but consider only a\nsubset of rows.\n\nPRACTICAL LIMITATIONS\n\nDue to computational intensity and the potential for generating huge result\nsets, cross joins can cause performance issues and are usually used cautiously\nin business scenarios.\n\nSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS\n\nThey should not be used in direct end-user interactions or exposed without\ncareful control, as they can inadvertently expose high level of data.\n\nFor example, a cross join between a customer table and a credit card\ntransactions table without any predicates like WHERE can multiply rows\nindiscriminately, possibly exposing sensitive information.\n\n\nREAL-WORLD EXAMPLE: CREATING A SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS\n\nWithout the need for any specific tables or complex logic, a cross join can be\nused to generate a sequence of numbers.\n\nFor example, when we run the below SQL query:\n\nSELECT (t1.number + t2.number) AS num\nFROM numbers t1, numbers t2;\n\n\nIt generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and going in multiples. This\ncan then be used in scenarios like splitting strings or generating sequences in\nthe absence of dedicated functions.\n\n\nPITFALLS TO AVOID\n\n * Performance:\n   While cross joins are an expedient method for particular tasks, their\n   computational overhead and the potential to produce large result sets can\n   cause performance problems.\n\n * Data Type Mismatches:\n   These joins are not selective; they essentially match any information type,\n   which can bring about unanticipated results.","index":32,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"34.\n\n\nHOW TO IMPLEMENT PAGINATION IN SQL QUERIES?","answer":"Pagination is essential for breaking down large result sets into manageable\nchunks.

SQL Code: Contains the instructions or statements to be executed.\n 2. Control-of-Flow Logic: Facilitates conditional processing and iteration,\n    similar to programming languages like if, else, and while.\n 3. Input/Output Parameters: Enable data exchange with the procedure.\n 4. Error-Handling: Supports exception management to handle potential failure\n    scenarios, ensuring data integrity.\n 5. Transaction Management: Embeds transactions to guarantee atomicity.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Improved Efficiency: Once stored in the database, the SQL statements don't\n   need to be recompiled, reducing processing time.\n * Enhanced Security: Credentials are kept confidential when invoking the stored\n   procedure. This also helps in avoiding SQL Injection because the parameters\n   are passed to the stored procedure differently. By using stored procedures,\n   SQL injection attacks are less likely to occur.\n * Simplified Management: Maintenance and updates are streamlined, which ensures\n   consistency across applications. It's especially useful in situations where\n   multiple applications or services need to access the same data and logic.\n * Optimized Network Traffic: Bundling multiple queries in one stored procedure\n   can reduce data transfer, minimizing network congestion.\n * Improved Consistency: As it's a centralized unit, there's consistency in data\n   processing and validation.\n * Version Control: Identifying and reverting to earlier versions of a stored\n   procedure enables setup flexibility when dealing with potential bugs or\n   malfunctions.\n\n\nENHANCED ANALYTICAL ABILITIES\n\n * Parameterized: Accepts input parameters, customizing its behavior on a\n   per-use basis.

This means that\nif any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and\nthe database state is left unchanged.\n\nEXAMPLE: BANK TRANSFER\n\nIf a bank transfer includes subtracting $100 from Account A and adding $100 to\nAccount B, both operations must succeed or fail together.\n\n\nCONSISTENCY\n\nAfter a transaction, the database remains in a consistent state. This means that\nany data modifications made during a transaction must adhere to all defined data\nintegrity constraints.\n\nEXAMPLE: BOOK INVENTORY MANAGEMENT\n\nIf a transaction involves purchasing a book, the database ensures that the\nbook's inventory is reduced by one, and this operation doesn't leave the\ninventory in a negative state.\n\n\nISOLATION\n\nEach transaction remains independent and isolated from other transactions. This\nensures that the intermediate states of concurrent transactions are not visible\nto each other.\n\nEXAMPLE: TICKET RESERVATION\n\nWhen a user is booking a ticket and another user is performing a similar\noperation at the same time, the databases should prevent scenarios such as both\nusers getting assigned the same seat.\n\n\nDURABILITY\n\nOnce a transaction is committed, its changes are persisted and retained, even in\nthe face of unexpected system failures.\n\nEXAMPLE: FLIGHT BOOKING\n\nSuppose you booked a flight and received a confirmation. Your booking is\npersisted in the database and remains intact, even if there is a sudden power\noutage or a hardware failure, ensuring the database is reliably durable.","index":44,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"46.\n\n\nWHAT IS DATABASE SHARDING?","answer":"Database sharding is a strategy that involves splitting a large database into\nsmaller, more manageable parts called shards. These shards can then be\ndistributed across multiple database servers (or nodes). When implemented\ncorrectly, sharding can significantly improve the scalability, performance, and\nendurance of a system.\n\n\nVERTICAL VS HORIZONTAL PARTITIONING\n\n * Vertical partitioning involves segmenting data based on distinct features\n   (e.g., size, type). While this method might reduce storage overhead, it\n   doesn't necessarily optimize transactional performance since all data within\n   a partition still resides on a single server.\n\n * Horizontal partitioning, which is what sharding is based on, divides data\n   across multiple nodes based on certain criteria.\n\n\nKEY-BASED AND RANGE-BASED SHARDING\n\n * Key-based (or Hash-based) sharding leverages consistent hashing to determine\n   the shard for a given key. While it provides a uniform distribution of data\n   and supports dynamic addition or removal of shards, it doesn't enable range\n   queries without visiting all shards.\n\n * Range-based sharding divides data into shards based on specific ranges of\n   values in a shard key, allowing more efficient range-based queries. However,\n   it can lead to unbalanced shards, especially with volatile data\n   distributions.\n\n\nPRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS IN SHARDING\n\n 1. Data Distribution: Sharding aims to achieve a roughly equal distribution of\n    data across shards to ensure all nodes contribute equally to the workload.\n\n 2. Location Transparency: The application should be able to locate the shard of\n    a given piece of data without having to manage this complexity directly.\n\n 3. Minimization of Cross-Shard Transactions: By avoiding transactions that\n    involve data across multiple shards, the overall system's efficiency and\n    consistency can be improved.\n\n 4. Resilience: Sharding should be designed to account for potential failures\n    within the system. For example, a single node failure shouldn't result in\n    the loss of data.\n\n\nSHARDING VS REPLICATION\n\nSharding and replication are complementary strategies for improving database\nperformance and resilience. Each strategy has its unique focus:\n\n * Sharding is primarily concerned with horizontal partitioning to distribute\n   data across multiple nodes to improve scalability and optimize query\n   performance.\n\n * Replication, on the other hand, involves the creation and maintenance of\n   redundant copies of data across multiple nodes for the purpose of high\n   availability and fault tolerance.\n\n\nCOMMON CHALLENGES WITH SHARDING\n\n * Ensuring Data Consistency: Maintaining data integrity in a distributed\n   environment can be challenging.\n\n * Adjusting for Data Growth: Implementations must be flexible enough to\n   accommodate both steady and rapid data growth.\n\n * Handling Complex Queries: Some types of queries, especially those that depend\n   on multiple data sets, can be challenging to handle in a sharded environment.\n\n * Selecting the Right Shard Key: The choice of the shard key can impact system\n   performance.

They help in\noptimizing query performance and spotting potential issues.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE EXPLAIN OR EXPLAIN ANALYZE?\n\n * EXPLAIN: Use this for a high-level outline of the query execution plan. It\n   provides information such as the operations involved and their order, without\n   actually running the query or accessing the table data.\n\n * EXPLAIN ANALYZE: This option is more resource-intensive because it executes\n   the query and provides real data pertaining to its performance and execution\n   plan. You should use it when you want a detailed look at your query's\n   performance characteristics and if you intend to make performance\n   adjustments.\n\n\nKEY METRICS TO LOOK OUT FOR\n\n * Cost: The estimated query execution cost, which takes into account both time\n   and resources. Lower cost is generally preferred.\n\n * Rows: Estimated number of rows generated at each step. Accuracy in these\n   estimates is crucial for effective query plan optimization.\n\n\nINTERPRETING THE OUTPUT\n\nBoth EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE generate a query plan. The former focuses on\nthe execution steps, while the latter gives a more comprehensive overview, often\nin a tree-like format.\n\nVisual representations of the query plan are typically provided, offering\ninsights into key phases like:\n\n * Scans and Joins: Identifying how data is retrieved and related, e.g., through\n   index or full table scans.\n\n * Aggregations and Sorts: If the query needs to sort or perform aggregate\n   functions.\n\n * Nested Loop, Hash, or Merge Joins: Different methods used to join data\n   sources, each with its performance implications.\n\n\nUSE CASES\n\n 1. Query Optimization: Either version of the command can assist in identifying\n    steps that might be computationally intensive or less efficient. It allows\n    for targeted improvements to these aspects.\n\n 2. Indexing: Checking which, if any, indices are being utilized by the query.\n    If the expected index isn't being used, the plan can inform how to adjust or\n    create new indices for better performance.\n\n 3. Troubleshooting Performance Issues: By inspecting the query plan, one can\n    often pinpoint parts of the query that are responsible for slower execution,\n    aiding in their improvement.\n\n 4. Educating Team Members: If your team is new to a complex query, showing them\n    the execution plan can simplify the understanding by breaking it down into\n    understandable portions.\n\n 5. Inspection: Especially during the development phase, using these commands\n    can help ensure that the underlying data and schema are being accessed as\n    intended.\n\n 6. Client Communications: Both EXPLAIN commands help in communicating the\n    potential performance improvements after making changes to a query, table\n    structure, or indexing.","index":52,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"54.\n\n\nHOW CAN INDEXING AFFECT PERFORMANCE BOTH POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY?","answer":"SQL indexing aims to enhance retrieval performance by optimizing data access.\n\n\nTYPES OF INDEXING\n\n * Unique Index: Ensures uniqueness in indexed columns; often implemented via\n   primary key constraints.\n * Non-Unique Indexes: Allow duplication in indexed columns.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION METRICS\n\n * Selectivity: Ratio of distinct indexed values to total rows.\n * Cardinality: Total number of unique values in an index.\n\n\nPOSITIVE PERFORMANCE BENEFITS FROM INDEXING\n\n * Faster Data Retrieval: Especially beneficial when handling large datasets.\n * Ordering and Grouping Optimizations: Useful for ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and\n   window functions.\n\n\nNEGATIVES OF OVER-INDEXING\n\n * Maintenance Overhead: Every write operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) requires\n   index updates.\n * Memory Consumption: Indexed data occupies additional storage in memory.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * Point Queries: Ideal for exact matches (e.g., primary keys).\n * Range Queries: Suitable for inequalities, such as age > 30.\n * Sorted and Grouped Data: Most databases, including PostgreSQL and MySQL, use\n   B-Tree data structures for better ordered data operations.\n * Joins: Integrated indexes can expedite join operations.","index":53,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"55.\n\n\nDESCRIBE HOW TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF SQL QUERIES.","answer":"Here are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure SQL query performance:\n\n\nQUERY EXECUTION TIME\n\nThe actual duration a query takes to execute.\n\n\nTOOLS TO MEASURE EXECUTION TIME\n\n 1.

It enforces a logical order for database actions, which\ninfluences performance in multi-user environments.\n\n\nTYPES OF LOCKS\n\nSHARED (S) AND EXCLUSIVE (X) LOCKS\n\n * S-Locks: Allow read access but not write, permitting multiple transactions to\n   read a resource.\n * X-Locks: Restrict both read and write access, ensuring no other transaction\n   operates on a resource.\n\nThis duality is where S-Locks differ from SIX-locks, which stand for Shared with\nIntent to eXclusive and are a hybrid type.\n\nKEY RANGE LOCKS\n\nThese locks pertain to a contiguous range of data. Operations on keys within\nthat range are prohibited, ensuring data consistency.\n\nUPDATE (U) AND INTENT (I) LOCKS\n\n * U-Locks are set on data to be updated within read-committed isolation. It's\n   used for a two-step read and update process.\n * I-Locks are \"parent\" locks indicating the intent of an operation to set other\n   lock types on \"child\" resources. For instance, setting an X lock on a table\n   sets IS locks on table pages. This helps enforce lock hierarchy.\n\nSPECIALIZED LOCKS\n\n * Bulk Update (BU) Locks: Applied during bulk operations.\n * Schema Locks (Sch-M): Enforced at a schema level, ensuring changes like table\n   modifications are exclusive.","index":66,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"68.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF TRANSACTIONS?","answer":"SQL transactions encompass a series of tasks performed as a single, atomic unit,\nensuring consistency, isolation, durability, and atomicity (often abbreviated as\nACID). These principles are foundational to reliable database management.\n\n\nACID PROPERTIES DEFINED\n\n * Atomicity: Transactions are all or nothing. If any part of a transaction\n   fails, the entire operation is rolled back to its original state.\n * Consistency: Transactions move the database from one consistent state to\n   another, maintaining referential integrity, data type and other constraints.\n * Isolation: The effect of one transaction is isolated from others until it's\n   committed, preventing interference and race conditions.\n * Durability: Once a transaction is successfully committed, its changes are\n   persistently stored in the database.\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\n\n * Atomicity: For instance, when booking a flight, simultaneous updates are made\n   to available seats and passenger manifests. If one step fails, the whole\n   operation is rolled back to prevent inconsistencies.\n * Consistency: An example is when a withdrawal is requested from a bank\n   account. The system ensures that the withdrawal does not leave the account in\n   an inconsistent state (e.g., overdraft or negative balance).\n * Isolation: This is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of\n   the database. For instance, if two users attempt to update the same record\n   simultaneously, isolation ensures that their actions are treated as\n   sequential to avoid data corruption.\n * Durability: This is crucial for ensuring that the data remains intact, even\n   in the face of system or database failure. Once a transaction is committed,\n   its changes are recorded permanently, and they will survive any subsequent\n   system crashes.\n\nSome of the isolation levels, such as \"Read Uncommitted”, might not fully abide\nby these principles.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TRANSACTIONS AND THE ACID PROPERTIES\n\nHere is the SQL code:\n\n-- Initiating a transaction\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\n-- Insert, update, delete etc.\n-- Transaction operations\nCOMMIT; -- To make the transaction permanent\nROLLBACK; -- To discard transaction changes\n","index":67,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"69.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MANAGE TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVELS?","answer":"Transaction Isolation Levels serve to dictate the degree of concurrency and\nconsistency within a database system.

Read Uncommitted: Transactions can access uncommitted data from other\n    transactions.\n 2. Read Committed: Transactions only access committed data by other\n    transactions.\n 3. Repeatable Read: Ensures data is unchanged during the course of a\n    transaction.\n 4. Serializable: Guarantees that transactions occur in a way that is equivalent\n    to a sequential execution.\n\n\nSQL STATEMENTS\n\nIsolation levels can be managed through specific SQL statements.\n\n * MySQL: SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ... or SET ...

These processes ensure the database\nremains consistent and resilient.\n\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES\n\n * Atomicity: A transaction is an indivisible unit of work. It either commits\n   entirely or gets rolled back as a whole, without leaving the database in a\n   partially updated state.\n\n * Consistency: Before and after a transaction, the database should adhere to\n   all its integrity constraints, maintaining its consistency. A failed\n   transaction will always get rolled back, ensuring this property.\n\n * Isolation: Before a transaction finishes, any changes it makes are invisible\n   to other concurrent transactions. This concept is about preserving the\n   integrity of the data even when multiple processes interact with it\n   simultaneously.\n\n * Durability: The changes committed by a transaction are persistently stored in\n   the database even in the case of a system failure.\n\n\nCOMMON PRACTICES\n\n * User-Controlled: In many database management systems (DBMS), transactions\n   begin manually with a specific instruction (\"BEGIN\") and end with an explicit\n   commit or rollback.\n\n * Auto-Commit: Some systems, by default or configuration, are in a mode where\n   each query is a transaction in itself which automatically commits after\n   executing successfully.\n\n * Explicit Control: It's standard practice in professional software development\n   to handle commits and rollbacks explicitly, ensuring the integrity of the\n   data.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MYSQL\n\n# Manual Transaction Control\nSTART TRANSACTION;\n    -- SQL Queries here\nCOMMIT; -- To save the changes\nROLLBACK; -- To discard the changes\n\n# Auto-Commit\nSET autocommit = 0; -- To disable auto-commit mode\n-- Individual SQL Commands\nSET autocommit = 1; -- To enable auto-commit again\n\n\n\nMULTI-STEP PROCESSES\n\n * Mandatory: Certain operations, like financial transactions, demand\n   non-negotiable transaction control to maintain data consistency.\n\n * Optional: Business or application-specific tasks might be grouped for clarity\n   and managed either atomically or individually based on their unique\n   requirements.\n\n * General: For most operations in a professional environment, explicit\n   transaction control is recommended to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n\n * Manual Cleanup: For transactions not explicitly committed or rolled back,\n   safeguards need to be in place to prevent any resulting data inconsistencies.\n   Such half-done transactions can cause issues in the database.\n\n\nIN PROFESSIONAL CONTEXTS:\n\n * Best Practice: It is often considered best to control transactions\n   explicitly, ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n\n * Consistent Approach: Adopting a consistent approach throughout your\n   application or system helps in adhering to transaction standards.\n   Business-critical functionalities especially benefit from this uniformity.\n\n * Error Handling: Managing exceptions and errors effectively is crucial. Commit\n   or rollback is often paired with try-catch blocks or equivalent mechanisms to\n   handle failures gracefully.\n\n * Transactional Resources: In advanced scenarios, such as involving distributed\n   transactions or managing non-database resources transactionally, specialized\n   tools are necessary.","index":69,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"71.\n\n\nHOW CAN SQL BE INTEGRATED WITH BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES?","answer":"SQL can seamlessly integrate with various big data technologies, offering a\nstandardized query language for data manipulation across diverse platforms.

While the ANSI SQL\nstandard aims to resolve these disparities, not all databases fully comply.\nHowever, by being mindful of these variations and using certain strategies, you\ncan design SQL scripts for enhanced portability.\n\n\nEFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR PORTABILITY\n\n1. LEVERAGE ANSI SQL\n\n * Focus on using ANSI-standard SQL queries, which are more universally\n   supported.\n * For instance, use INNER JOIN instead of database-specific alternatives like\n   += for Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n2. BE MINDFUL OF SYNTAX DIFFERENCES\n\n * Take note of variations in syntax and keywords across databases.\n * For example, quoting identifiers like table and column names can differ, with\n   MySQL using backticks and MSSQL employing square brackets.\n\n3. USE DYNAMIC SQL APPROPRIATELY\n\n * Employ programming languages to generate SQL statements dynamically when the\n   task is complex and there are no portable solutions.\n * Use caution, however, to mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n4. LIMIT DEPENDENCIES ON ADVANCED FEATURES\n\n * Constrain your scripts to commonly supported features across databases.\n * For example, avoid vendor-specific functions, unique to certain databases,\n   such as NVL in Oracle.\n\n5. TEST AGAINST MULTIPLE DATABASE SYSTEMS\n\n * Validate your scripts across different database platforms to identify\n   compatibility issues early on.\n\n\nTOOLS FOR SCRIPT PORTABILITY\n\nSeveral tools and frameworks, such as ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers), solve\nmany of the cross-database compatibility problems.\n\n * NHibernate: It's an object-relation mapping library for the .NET platform. It\n   provides a complete framework for mapping object-oriented domain models to a\n   traditional relational database.\n\n * Entity Framework: A set of technologies in ADO.NET that helps you to build\n   data-oriented software applications.\n\n * Hibernate: A popular ORM tool for Java.\n\nORMs provide a higher level of abstraction, enabling database-agnostic\noperations depending on the ORM's level of compliance with the various target\ndatabase systems.

Schema Comparison Tools: Many tools, like SQL Server Management Studio and\n    Redgate SQL Compare, compare database schemas and can be useful for\n    versioning changes. These tools can often be integrated with VCS systems.\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Regular Backups: Frequent backups allow recovery to a specific point in time\n   in case of errors or unwanted changes.\n * Robust Change Management Process: Document and test changes, and ensure that\n   only approved changes are committed to the database.","index":77,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"79.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF USING STORED PROCEDURES INSTEAD OF EMBEDDING SQL\nQUERIES IN CODE?","answer":"Stored procedures offer several advantages over embedding raw SQL queries\ndirectly into application code.\n\n 1. Improved Security:\n    \n    * Stored procedures can enforce strict access control by granting execution\n      rights without directly providing table access.\n    * This bolsters data privacy and reduces the risk of unauthorized changes or\n      leaks.\n\n 2. Enhanced Performance:\n    \n    * Once compiled, stored procedures are often faster as they minimize the\n      network overhead by sending only the procedure name and its parameters.\n\n 3. Simplified Maintenance:\n    \n    * If there's a need to tweak a query, you can simply modify the stored\n      procedure without having to locate and update all the spots where the\n      query is written throughout the application.\n\n 4. Consistent Data Integrity and Validations:\n    \n    * You can embed business rules and data integrity checks within the stored\n      procedure, providing a central point for the enforcement of these rules.\n\n 5. Reduced Code Duplication:\n    \n    * Multiple applications can call the same stored procedure, ensuring\n      consistency in data processing.\n\n 6. Code Centralization and Abstraction:\n    \n    * By moving SQL logic into stored procedures, you can abstract and separate\n      the database layer, making your system modular and easier to maintain.\n\n 7. Transaction Management:\n    \n    * Stored procedures can help encapsulate multiple SQL operations within a\n      single transaction, ensuring all or nothing processing.\n\n 8.

The approach you'll choose might\ndepend on the specific database system and version you are using. Here, I will\nguide you through both methods.\n\n\nGENERAL WORKFLOW\n\n 1. Remove Duplicates: In order to find the Nth highest salary, you need to\n    handle cases when there are repeated salary values. You can use the DISTINCT\n    keyword or choose from a subquery that selects unique salary values.\n\n 2. Order Salaries: Organize salaries in either ascending (:arrow_up:) or\n    descending (:arrow_down:) order, then use a selection method, such as LIMIT,\n    to target the desired rank.\n\n 3. Execute SQL Query: Apply the query you devised to the specific RDBMS you are\n    using to obtain the Nth highest salary.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE FOR MYSQL\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\nSELECT \n    salary\nFROM \n    employee\nORDER BY \n    salary DESC\nLIMIT 1 OFFSET (N-1);\n\n\nFor PostgreSQL and SQL Server:\n\nSELECT \n    salary\nFROM \n    employee\nORDER BY \n    salary DESC\nOFFSET (N-1) ROWS\nFETCH FIRST ROW ONLY;\n\n\n\nWINDOWS FUNCTIONS VS. SUBQUERIES\n\n * Modern Approach: Windows functions are more current and database-agnostic.\n   If, however, you are dealing with legacy systems, using a subquery might\n   prove more compatible.\n\n * Efficiency: With windows functions, the sorting operation happens only once.\n   In contrast, a subquery will re-sort the dataset for every outer LIMIT used.\n\n * Code Manageability: Windows functions offer a more structured and readable\n   syntax, often preferred by SQL developers. However, if you're more\n   comfortable with a subquery or have specific performance concerns, that\n   method could be better suited.","index":80,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"82.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OF A SPECIFIC VALUE IN A COLUMN?","answer":"To count the occurrences of a specific value in an SQL column, you can use the\nCOUNT function with a WHERE clause, or SUM in combination with a CASE statement.\n\n\nBASIC APPROACHES\n\nUSING COUNT WITH WHERE\n\nThe COUNT method counts instances of a specific value in a given column when\ncombined with a WHERE clause.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\nSELECT COUNT(id) AS count_2\nFROM my_table\nWHERE name = 'John';\n\n\nUSING SUM AND CASE\n\nAnother approach is using SUM with a CASE statement that evaluates a boolean\ncondition for each row, assigning a value of 1 if true and 0 if false.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN name = 'John' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_2\nFROM my_table;\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING MYSQL\n\nHere is the code:\n\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\n    id INT,\n    name VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\nINSERT INTO my_table (id, name) VALUES\n(1, 'John'),\n(2, 'Doe'),\n(3, 'John');\n\nSELECT COUNT(id) AS count_1\nFROM my_table\nWHERE name = 'John';\n\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN name = 'John' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_2\nFROM my_table;\n","index":81,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"83.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU CALCULATE RUNNING TOTALS IN SQL?","answer":"Let's examine how you can break down running totals into two categories: simple\nand complex.

You can manage timestamps\nwith:\n\n * DATETIME: Captures the date and time to the nearest millisecond.\n * TIMESTAMP (ROWVERSION): Automatically updates each time a row is modified,\n   ensuring better control for concurrency.\n\nFor highly regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, using precise and\nimmutable timestamps is imperative.\n\nSEQUENCING DATA\n\nDatabase environments often necessitate a clear temporal order for data\nmanagement or resolving potential conflicts. To this end, SQL databases provide:\n\n * SEQUENCE: Ensures unique values across tables with a 'next value' mechanism.\n   Useful in scenarios where meticulous ordering of operations is critical.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Standardize Time Zone Data: Use a consistent time zone such as UTC across\n   your applications for an accurate, centralized reference.\n\n * Data Integrity: Enforce data integrity with constraints such as foreign keys,\n   declarative referential integrity, and triggers.\n\n * Versioned Tables: Maintain history with versioned tables or setups like\n   Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) to track changes to dimensions over time.\n\n * Consider Multi-Version Concurrency Control: Across different systems,\n   deployments, or database technologies, multi-version concurrency control can\n   help achieve consistent, reliable queries for temporal data.\n\n * Adhere to Regulations: Industries such as healthcare, finance, or e-commerce\n   might be legally required to hold past data. Ensure compliance with relevant\n   regulations.\n\n\nSQL DESIGN PATTERNS FOR TIME MANAGEMENT\n\nOpting for data modeling techniques tailored for temporal data and time zones\naids in the accurate preservation of historical records and facilitates ease of\nuse across various time zones.\n\n * Application-Based Time Zone Conversion: Let the applications handle time zone\n   conversions instead of tasking the database. However, this might lead to\n   inconsistencies if the application has many entry points.\n\n * Separating Timestamps from Application Time: Distinctly capture when a data\n   element is recorded by the application and when it's entered into the\n   database. This separation is crucial for preserving when an event actually\n   occurred, even if significant delays are present between recording it and\n   entering it.\n\n * Anchor-Based Design: Utilize a primary table that serves as an anchor for\n   time. Subsidiary tables would then have foreign keys referencing the primary\n   table alongside timestamps, ensuring a clear historical record and its\n   associations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WORKING WITH TIME ZONES\n\nHere is SQL code for the most recent timestamp from employees in the \"New York\"\ntime zone.\n\nSELECT TOP 1 * \nFROM T_Employees\nWHERE TIMEZONE = 'America/New_York'\nORDER BY RecordTimestamp DESC;\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IMPLEMENTING AUDIT TRAIL\n\nHere is the SQL code for creating an audit table that logs changes to a primary\ntable.\n\n-- Creating the primary table (in this case, `T_Employees`)\nCREATE TABLE T_Employees (\n    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    EmployeeName NVARCHAR(100),\n    RecordTimestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    TIMEZONE NVARCHAR(50)  -- Assuming the TIMEZONE is captured\n);\n\n-- Creating the audit table to track changes\nCREATE TABLE T_Employees_Audit (\n    AuditID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,\n    EmployeeID INT,\n    EmployeeName NVARCHAR(100),\n    RecordTimestamp DATETIME,\n    TIMEZONE NVARCHAR(50),\n    AuditAction NVARCHAR(10),  -- Action types such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n    ActionTimestamp DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()\n);\n","index":93,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"95.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU USE SQL IN FINANCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR RISK AND PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS?","answer":"SQL is employed in multiple ways for financial applications such as risk\nassessment and portfolio analysis.\n\n\nCOMMON SCENARIOS\n\n 1.

On the other hand, distributed computing\nplatforms like Apache Hive can deploy models extensively.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING IN-DATABASE MACHINE LEARNING\n\nHere is the T-SQL code:\n\n-- Select data for model and create training/testing datasets\nSELECT\n    Feature1, Feature2, ..., Label\nINTO \n    TrainingData\nFROM\n    YourTable\n...\n\nSELECT\n    Feature1, Feature2, ..., Label\nINTO \n    TestingData\nFROM\n    YourTable\n...\n\n-- Train the model\nEXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R',\n    @script = N'\n        model <- glm(Label ~ Feature1 + Feature2, data=InputDataSet, family=binomial)\n    ',\n    @input_data_1 = N'SELECT * FROM TrainingData'\n\n-- Evaluate the model\nEXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R',\n    @script = N'\n        pred <- predict(model, newdata=InputDataSet, type=\"response\")\n        result <- data.frame(actual=InputDataSet$Label, predicted=pred)\n    ',\n    @input_data_1 = N'SELECT * FROM TestingData'\n\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * The utility of SQL extends beyond data retrieval and storage.\n * Modern RDBMS products have evolved to include machine learning libraries and\n   advanced analytics.\n * RDBMSs and NoSQL databases cater to different stages in the machine learning\n   lifecycle.","index":99,"topic":" SQL ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
