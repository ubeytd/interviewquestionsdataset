Responsiveness: React to events and failures in a timely manner. Ensure\n    application and network latency is minimal.\n\n 2. Resilience: Due to potential failures in distributed operations, reactive\n    systems should remain responsive and consistent. They should recover and\n    maintain operations in less than optimal times.\n\n 3. Elasticity: Able to manage varying volumes of traffic by scaling resources\n    accordingly.\n\n 4. Message-Driven: Communication among system components is achieved through\n    asynchronous message passing rather than more resource-intensive and less\n    flexible mechanisms such as shared memory or method calls.\n\n\nADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\n 5. Back-Pressure: Systems should apply back-pressure to prevent resource\n    exhaustion by striving to keep the speed of message production and message\n    processing in balance.\n\n 6. Resource Efficiency: They should use resources in a way that ensures the\n    most efficient possible outcome. This means recognizing that resources are\n    limiting and shared and managing them accordingly.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BACK-PRESSURE IN AKKA STREAMS\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\nfinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> source = Source.range(1, 100);\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> flow = Flow.of(Integer.class).map(i -> i * 2);\nfinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Done>> sink = Sink.foreach(System.out::println);\n\nsource.via(flow).to(sink).withAttributes(Attributes.createLogLevels(Logging.DebugLevel(), Logging.InfoLevel()))\n    .run(materializer);\n\n\nHere is the Scala code:\n\nval source = Source(1 to 100)\nval flow = Flow[Int].map(_ * 2)\nval sink = Sink.foreach[Int](println)\n\nsource.via(flow).to(sink).withAttributes(ActorAttributes.dispatcher(\"my-dispatcher\")).run()\n","index":0,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nHOW IS BACK-PRESSURE IMPLEMENTED IN REACTIVE SYSTEMS TO MANAGE DATA FLOW?","answer":"Back-pressure establishes control over data flow, ensuring asynchronous\nprocesses operate within defined resource limitations. It is a foundational\nconcept in reactive systems, where components gracefully handle and communicate\nload imbalances.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS FOR BACK-PRESSURE\n\n * Data Producer: Generates items to be processed.\n * Data Consumer: Receives and processes items.\n * Communication Channel: Connects producer and consumer for data transfer.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION PARADIGMS\n\n * Push Model: - Producers actively deliver data.\n * Pull Model: - Consumers dictate the pace of data arrival by requesting.\n\n\nBACK-PRESSURE STRATEGIES\n\n * Buffering: Temporarily stores data to regulate the flow between producer and\n   consumer. Beyond a certain threshold, producers are signaled to slow down or\n   stop.\n\n * Dropping: When buffer limits are reached, newer items replace older ones.\n   This strategy is useful when older items become less relevant.\n\n * Throttling: Dynamically controls how much data a producer can send. Common\n   techniques include rate limiting and data batching.\n\n * Dynamic Scaling of Resources: Solutions like auto-scaling cloud environments\n   allow for quick adaptation to processing demands, ensuring resources match\n   system requirements.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: THROTTLING WITH OBSERVABLE\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nvar source = Observable.Interval(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(200));\n\nvar throttled = source\n    .Throttle(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));\n\nvar subscription = throttled.Subscribe(\n    Console.WriteLine,\n    ex => Console.WriteLine(\"Error: \" + ex.Message),\n    () => Console.WriteLine(\"Completed\"));\n\nConsole.ReadLine();\n\n\nIn this example, an observable sequence is created that emits an integer every\n200 milliseconds. The Throttle operator is then applied to ensure items are\nemitted not more frequently than once per second.\n\n\nTRADE-OFFS AND CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Resource Utilization: Buffering, while offering immediate handling of peaks,\n   can lead to resource saturation if sustained for prolonged periods.\n\n * Latency: Using buffers to handle peaks introduces a delay, which might not be\n   acceptable in certain real-time scenarios.\n\n * Dropping Items: Can simplify the system and reduce resource usage under heavy\n   loads, but comes with the trade-off of potentially discarding important data.\n\n * Simple vs. More Complex Strategies: Depending on the system and its\n   requirements, simpler strategies might suffice. More intricate methods like\n   adaptive processing might introduce unnecessary complexity.","index":1,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nCONTRAST ELASTICITY WITH SCALABILITY WITH SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AS THEY PERTAIN TO\nREACTIVE SYSTEMS.","answer":"Scalability is a system's ability to handle increasingly higher workloads. This\ncan be horizontal, involving the addition of more nodes NNN, or vertical,\nmeaning the increase of a node's capability.\n\nElasticity, on the other hand, is a dynamic, on-demand allocation and\ndeallocation of resources to meet fluctuating workloads. Typically, this\npertains to cloud-based solutions where resources are provisioned or\nde-provisioned in real-time based on demand to minimize costs.\n\nIn Reactive systems, both scalability and elasticity are essential. The system\nshould be able to handle varying loads, commonly seen in modern applications,\nsuch as social media platforms.\n\n\nEXAMPLES IN REACTIVE SYSTEMS\n\nHORIZONTAL SCALABILITY\n\n * In Action: A social media platform adds more database servers in response to\n   an ever-increasing number of users.\n * Key Mechanism: Load Balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple\n   application instances.\n\nVERTICAL SCALABILITY\n\n * In Action: A system that processes financial transactions gets an increase in\n   hardware resources to meet higher demand.\n * Key Mechanism: The entire workload is handled by a single, more powerful\n   machine rather than being distributed.\n\nELASTICITY IN VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMS)\n\n * In Action: A cloud-based application, hosted on virtual machines, adjusts the\n   number of VM instances based on current traffic patterns.\n * Key Mechanism: Cloud management systems monitor resource usage and spawn or\n   terminate VMs as necessary.\n\nELASTICITY IN CONTAINERS\n\n * In Action: A microservice-based system deployed with containers adjusts the\n   number of running containers for each service based on traffic load.\n * Key Mechanism: Container Orchestration tools like Kubernetes dynamically\n   manage the number of containers to match the current load.","index":2,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nDESCRIBE A STRATEGY A REACTIVE SYSTEM MIGHT USE TO MAINTAIN RESPONSIVENESS\nDURING A COMPONENT FAILURE.","answer":"Reactive Systems are designed to handle failures gracefully using techniques\nsuch as Location Transparency, Dynamic Message Routing and Load Balancing.\n\n\nKEY MECHANISMS FOR FAILURE HANDLING\n\n * Location Transparency: Systems like Akka ensure that actors, which are key\n   processing units in the system, are isolated from their actual physical\n   location. The system abstracts the system location from the endpoint that\n   communicates with the actor, allowing it to be resilient to location-specific\n   failures.\n\n * Dynamic Message Routing: In distributed systems, where individual components\n   can fail, it's crucial that systems redirect traffic or messages from the\n   failing component to a healthy one. Akka, for example, ensures this with its\n   actor-based model. If an actor fails for some reason, its supervisor can\n   detect this and redirect its messages to a backup or alternative actor.\n\n * Adaptive Load Balancing: Systems like Akka can intelligently distribute\n   incoming load or messages across all available actors. If a target actor\n   becomes unresponsive, Akka can detect this and re-route messages to other\n   available actors.\n\n * Eventual Consistency: Rather than enforcing immediate and precise\n   consistency, certain distributed architectures allow for eventual\n   consistency. This means that, after a system recovers from a failure, it\n   might take some time to completely reconcile the data or state across the\n   system. Tools like CRDTs can assist in achieving this eventual consistency.\n\n * Graceful Degradation: When failing under heavy loads, systems might choose to\n   reduce their performance in a graceful manner, making sure not to collapse\n   completely. This especially helps in maintaining stability during periods of\n   excessive traffic or component failure.\n\n * Asynchronous Operations: By performing tasks asynchronously and potentially\n   non-blocking on event-driven systems, components can stay responsive even\n   under heavy load or when waiting for operations to complete.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: \"REACTIVE SYSTEM FAILURE HANDLING\"\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\nimport akka.actor.*;\nimport akka.routing.*;\nimport akka.japi.pf.ReceiveBuilder;\n\npublic class FailureHandling extends AbstractActor {\n    private final ActorRef router;\n\n    public FailureHandling() {\n        router = getContext().actorOf(FromConfig.getInstance().props(), \"router\");\n\n        receive(ReceiveBuilder.\n            matchAny(this::handle).\n            build());\n    }\n\n    private void handle(Object message) {\n        // Send messages to the router\n        router.tell(message, getSender());\n    }\n\n    static public void main(String[] args) {\n        // Instantiate the ActorSystem and the FailureHandling actor\n        ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create(\"FailureHandlingSystem\");\n        ActorRef failureHandling = system.actorOf(Props.create(FailureHandling.class), \"failureHandling\");\n\n        // Use the `fireMissiles` method to simulate an incoming message to the `FailureHandling` actor\n        failureHandling.tell(\"fireMissiles\", ActorRef.noSender());\n    }\n}\n","index":3,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nHOW DOES MESSAGE-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESILIENCE OF REACTIVE\nSYSTEMS?","answer":"Message-driven architecture is fundamental to building resilient and efficient\nreactive systems.

One such strategy is Event Sourcing, which helps systems regain\ntheir state after failure.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Commands: Actions or intentions sent from users or systems to modify state.\n * Events: Immutable facts representing state changes resultant from commands.\n * Event Store: A durable data store that logs all published events.\n\n\nHOW EVENT SOURCING WORKS\n\n 1. Event Recording: The system records every state change as an immutable event\n    in the event store. This feature ensures data integrity while making it\n    simpler to audit and debug state changes.\n\n 2. State Reconstruction: To generate its current state, the system re-processes\n    all historical events from the event store. This process is dynamic and\n    transparent, enabling the system to adapt to changes in processing logic\n    over time.\n\n 3. Fast Append-only Stores: Most modern implementations use data stores\n    optimized for high-throughput, low-latency append operations. This feature\n    streamlines the process of recording events.\n\n\nRESILIENCY & FAILOVER MECHANISMS\n\n * Operational Recovery: After a failure, the system reverts to a consistent\n   state by replaying logged events. This rollback mechanism safeguards against\n   downtime caused by failed state modifications.\n\n * Isolation & Integrity: Each recorded event is independent and self-contained,\n   assuring that a failure affecting one event doesn't compromise the entire\n   system or the consistency of other events.\n\n * Audit & Debug Capability: Full event logs enable precise identification of\n   the point in time where issues occurred. This aids in forensic analysis and\n   can be valuable in complying with auditing standards.\n\n * Ease of Temporal Reversion: The append-only nature of event stores makes\n   retractions or rectifications of unintended state changes possible.

Without them, systems can become slow\nand unresponsive.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: BLOCKING I/O OPERATIONS\n\nIn traditional synchronous models, a process awaiting I/O is blocked, meaning\nit's inactive and consuming resources without performing any useful work. This\nleads to poor resource utilization and performance degradation, especially in\nenvironments like user interfaces and servers.\n\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nConsider the scenario where data is arriving at unpredictable, potentially high\nrates. If the system used blocking I/O, efficiency and performance could be\nmarred by these issues:\n\n * Resource Wastage: Threads are an example of costly resources that might be\n   inappropriately occupied because of blocked I/O operations.\n * Queuing & Backpressure: Mechanisms to manage data overflow could be missing\n   or inefficient.\n * Responsiveness: Without a non-blocking approach, a system can become\n   unresponsive, struggling to process new requests amidst lingering I/O\n   operations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BLOCKING WRITE OPERATION\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\npublic void blockingWrite(String text) {\n    try {\n        // This operation blocks until the entire text is written to disk.\n        fileWriter.write(text);\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nTHE SOLUTION: NON-BLOCKING I/O OPERATIONS\n\nNon-blocking I/O operations free up resources during waiting times, enabling\nmore efficient multitasking without the overheads linked to blocking operations.\nAsynchronous Data Handling better aligns with the nature of real-world,\nunpredictable data sources, such as network requests and UI events.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: NON-BLOCKING WRITE OPERATION\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\npublic void nonBlockingWrite(String text, Consumer<Boolean> onComplete) {\n    fileWriter.write(text, result -> {\n        if (result) {\n            // Perform additional operations when the write finishes.\n            onComplete.accept(true);\n        } else {\n            onComplete.accept(false);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n\n\nCOMBINED BENEFITS OF NON-BLOCKING I/O AND REACTIVE PROGRAMMING\n\n * Resource Efficiency: Only engaged when necessary, conserving resources.\n * Responsiveness: Uninterrupted, near-real-time processing of data.\n * Concurrency & Multitasking: Optimized for multitasking without thread\n   overutilization or contention.\n * Scalability: Can manage high data volumes without overwhelming the system.\n * Predictability: Well-defined control mechanisms like backpressure to manage\n   data flows.","index":6,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nIN WHAT WAYS CAN DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN (DDD) PRINCIPLES ENHANCE THE DESIGN OF A\nREACTIVE SYSTEM?","answer":"Domain-Driven Design (DDD), with its focus on problem domains, makes a natural\npairing with Reactive Systems, which emphasize responsiveness, elasticity, and\nmessage-driven interactions.\n\nBy combining the two methodologies, designers can build complex, reactive\nsystems that better encapsulate problem domains.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\nBOUNDED CONTEXTS\n\n * DDD: Defines clear boundaries for the domain model, ensuring contextual\n   integrity.\n * Reactive: Supports isolation and decoupling, key prerequisites for bounded\n   contexts.\n\nEVENT-DRIVEN COLLABORATION\n\n * DDD: Leverages domain events to facilitate communication between elements in\n   the domain model.\n * Reactive: Emphasizes event-driven interactions, aligning with DDD's event\n   sourcing and business event concepts.\n\nCONTEXT MAPS\n\n * DDD: Outlines the relationships between bounded contexts, guiding the\n   system's modularity and integration.\n * Reactive: Enforces loose coupling for better resilience and scalability,\n   aligning with the need to integrate across contexts.\n\nPLATFORM-AGNOSTIC DESIGN\n\n * DDD: Encourages the domain model to be independent of technical\n   considerations, focusing instead on solving domain problems effectively.\n * Reactive: Enhances adaptability and compatibility by avoiding technological\n   entanglements, a principle known as reactive system autonomy.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: E-COMMERCE SYSTEM\n\nConsider a DDD-based e-commerce system:\n\nBOUNDED CONTEXTS\n\nThe system may be divided into several bounded contexts, such as inventory\nmanagement, order processing, and customer relations.

This\n   means that if an actor encounters an error, its supervisor can decide how to\n   handle the failure, making the system more resilient.\n\n * Location Transparency: Akka Actors can be distributed across multiple nodes\n   in a network, and the developer can treat them the same way as they would\n   local actors.\n\n * Cluster Support: Akka provides tools for managing and scaling clusters of\n   nodes. It offers features like cluster sharding, which helps in distributing\n   and load balancing actors within a cluster.\n\n * Persistence: Akka Persistence allows for event sourcing, a technique where an\n   application's state is determined by the sequence of events that led up to\n   it.\n\n * Message-driven Communication: Communication between actors is asynchronous.\n   This mechanism ensures loose coupling and enables better system\n   responsiveness.\n\n * Powerful Toolkit: Akka includes modules for HTTP, streams, and more, making\n   it a comprehensive choice for building reactive systems.\n\n * Built-in Testing Support: The Akka toolkit also includes modules for robust\n   testing, including specialized framework for actor-based systems.","index":16,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"18.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW STATEFULNESS IS MANAGED IN REACTIVE MICROSERVICES WHILE ENSURING\nCONSISTENCY.","answer":"In Reactive Microservices, managing statefulness is crucial for maintaining data\nconsistency across the system.

REST vs. Stateful Services: RESTful microservices are typically stateless,\n    whereas stateful services are more common in event-driven architectures.\n\n 2. Distributed Data Stores: Each microservice may have its own data store,\n    potentially making them stateful.\n\n 3. Timing Dependencies: In a distributed system, timing can be inconsistent,\n    posing challenges for managing state across services.\n\n\nENSURING DATA CONSISTENCY\n\n 1. ACID Transactions: Although traditional ACID transactions provide data\n    consistency, they are not well-suited for distributed systems.\n\n 2. BASE Model: An alternative to ACID, offering three levels of consistency:\n    Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventual consistency.\n\n 3. Idempotency: Actions can be designed to have the same effect whether\n    executed once or multiple times, ensuring consistency.\n\n 4. CQRS: The Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern separates read\n    and write operations, simplifying consistency challenges.\n\n 5. Eventual Consistency: Certain systems prioritize eventual consistency,\n    acknowledging that data might be inconsistent in real-time but will converge\n    over time.\n\n 6. Consensus Algorithms: Techniques like the Raft or Paxos protocols enable\n    distributed systems to reach a consensus on the state.\n\n 7. Sagas: A design pattern that orchestrates a series of local transactions\n    across multiple services, ensuring eventual consistency.\n\n 8.

Implementing a strong back-pressure mechanism\nis an effective strategy for achieving this balance.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS FOR AN EFFECTIVE BACK-PRESSURE STRATEGY\n\n 1. Monitor: Employ a metrics tool that continuously benchmarks system metrics\n    like latency, throughput, and resource usage.\n\n 2. Decider: Establish tunable decision policies, either automatic or manual,\n    that define acceptable system states. These policies should trigger\n    back-pressure actions when these states are exceeded.\n\n 3. Enforcer: Implement back-pressure tactics such as rate-limiting, queuing,\n    and task cancellation based on the decisions taken by the Decider.\n\n 4. Router: Introduce logic to redirect incoming workloads to alternative paths\n    when primary processing units are overloaded.\n\n 5. Sender: Establish feedback loops to relay contextual information, like\n    throughput limits or reasons for rejection, to client components.\n\n 6. Receiver: Subscriptions or clients should actively handle the feedback for a\n    coherent back-pressure strategy.\n\n\nPRACTICAL BACK-PRESSURE METHODS\n\n * Rate Limiting: Cap the number of tasks or messages processed over a\n   designated time frame. This strategy is beneficial when the system can\n   anticipate the workloads' processing times.\n\n * Queuing: Utilize internal or external queues to manage inflow to a system\n   component when facing overloads. A popular choice is the Leaky Bucket\n   algorithm that adheres to a preset rate.\n\n * Task Cancellation: For resource-intensive tasks, the system might opt to halt\n   or defer tasks, especially when the resources required exceed available\n   limits.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BACK-PRESSURE WITH QUEUES\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom threading import Thread, Condition\nimport time\n\nclass Producer(Thread):\n    def __init__(self, condition, queue):\n        super(Producer, self).__init__()\n        self.condition = condition\n        self.queue = queue\n\n    def run(self):\n        for i in range(10):\n            with self.condition:\n                while len(self.queue) >= 5:  # queue size limit\n                    self.condition.wait()\n                self.queue.append(i)\n                print(\"Produced:\", i)\n                self.condition.notify()\n\nclass Consumer(Thread):\n    def __init__(self, condition, queue):\n        super(Consumer, self).__init__()\n        self.condition = condition\n        self.queue = queue\n\n    def run(self):\n        for i in range(10):\n            with self.condition:\n                while len(self.queue) == 0:  # wait if queue is empty\n                    self.condition.wait()\n                item = self.queue.pop(0)\n                print(\"Consumed:\", item)\n                self.condition.notify()\n\nqueue = []\ncondition = Condition()\n\nproducer = Producer(condition, queue)\nconsumer = Consumer(condition, queue)\n\nproducer.start()\nconsumer.start()\n\nproducer.join()\nconsumer.join()\n","index":23,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"25.\n\n\nDESCRIBE A SUPERVISION STRATEGY IN REACTIVE SYSTEMS AND ITS ROLE IN MANAGING\nFAILURES.","answer":"In Reactive Systems, the supervision strategy guides how parent components ought\nto react when their child components fail. This pattern is particularly\nprominent in actor-based systems such as Akka.\n\nThe core principle is to enable graceful system degradation and recovery when\nfailures occur.\n\n\nTYPES OF SUPERVISION STRATEGIES\n\n 1. One for All: Any child failure prompts a restart of all other siblings and\n    the parent, ensuring a clean state for the entire group.\n\n 2. One for One: Tailored for each child, a failure results in the immediate\n    restart of that specific child.\n\n 3. Rest for One: This strategy is more relaxed, only leading to the restart of\n    the failed child. This approach can be useful to handle specific failure\n    cases.\n\n\nSUPERVISION DOMAINS\n\nSupervision strategies in many cases are organized in hierarchical structures or\n\"domains\", supporting a tailored response to failures in distinct parts of the\nsystem based on criticality, sensitivity, or purpose.\n\nFor instance, in an online marketplace, the real-time transaction handling might\nbe a mechanism set apart from the user management system or product\nrecommendation engine. Each section can have its supervision strategy,\noptimizing both availability and consistency for the platform as a whole.\n\n\nSUPERVISION LEVELS IN AKKA\n\nIn Akka, there are two inherent levels of supervision:\n\n * Top-Level for System Stability: Governed by the Guardian Actor (its parent is\n   the System Guardian), managing system health and stability by supervising\n   elements that are directly under its control.\n\n * Lower Levels for Task Optimization: Direct supervision of the actor's\n   specific children for more fine-grained control tailored to the application\n   logic.\n\n\nSUPERVISION STRATEGIES AS FAILURE MANAGEMENT TOOLS\n\nIn any environment, but particularly in dynamic, concurrent, or distributed ones\nsuch as Reactive Systems, failures are an anticipated and managed aspect, rather\nthan an exception.\n\nBy making failures a predictable part of the environment, systems become more\nresilient, exhibiting the ability to continue functioning accurately even in the\npresence of transient upsets.\n\nThe success of applications and services is not solely measured by their initial\ndeployment but by their unyielding reliability and consistent operation over\ntime.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ONEFORONESUPERVISOR\n\nHere is the Scala code:\n\nimport akka.actor.{Actor, ActorLogging, ActorRef, ActorSystem, OneForOneStrategy, Props}\nimport akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy._\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\n\nclass SomeActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {\n  override def preStart(): Unit = log.info(\"SomeActor started\")\n\n  override def preRestart(reason: Throwable, message: Option[Any]): Unit =\n    log.info(s\"SomeActor restarting due to: ${reason.getMessage}\")\n\n  override def postStop(): Unit = log.info(\"SomeActor stopped\")\n\n  def receive: Receive = {\n    case \"fail\" => throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Explicit failure\")\n    case _      => log.info(\"Received a message\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Supervisor extends Actor with ActorLogging {\n  override val supervisorStrategy: OneForOneStrategy = OneForOneStrategy(maxNrOfRetries = 10, withinTimeRange = 1.minute) {\n    case _: IllegalArgumentException       => Restart\n    case _: UnsupportedOperationException  => Stop\n    case _: Exception                    => Escalate\n  }\n\n  val child: ActorRef = context.actorOf(Props[SomeActor], \"child\")\n  context.watch(child)\n\n  def receive: Receive = {\n    case msg => child ! msg\n  }\n}\n\nval system = ActorSystem(\"supervision-demo\")\nval supervisor = system.actorOf(Props[Supervisor], \"supervisor\")\n\nsupervisor ! \"hello\"  // Trigger a message\nThread.sleep(1000)  // Sleep for a second to observe effects during this timespan\nsupervisor ! \"fail\"  // Cause intentional failure\n","index":24,"topic":" Reactive Systems ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"26.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW REACTIVE SYSTEMS EXPLOIT MULTICORE_ AND DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES TO\nIMPROVE PERFORMANCE.","answer":"Reactive Systems leverage asynchronous and non-blocking operations to harness\nthe power of multicore CPUs and distributed networks for optimized performance.\n\n\nMULTICORE UTILIZATION\n\nReactive Systems break down tasks into smaller, independent units.
