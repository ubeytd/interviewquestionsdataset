Service Interface: Defines the contract between the service provider and the\n    client component.\n\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES\n\n * Inversion of Control: Modules should depend on abstractions rather than\n   concrete implementations, and these abstractions will be provided externally.\n * Separation of Concerns: Ensures that each module is responsible for its\n   specific task, and dependencies are managed externally.\n\n\nTHE 3 VARIANTS OF DI\n\n 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through the constructor.\n    \n    Code Example\n    \n    public class ClientComponent {\n        private final IService service;\n        public ClientComponent(IService service) {\n            this.service = service;\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n 2.

It does this by introducing an abstraction that both\nhigh-level and low-level modules depend on.\n\n\nIOC AND ABSTRACTION\n\n * Traditional Control: In class-based programming, when an object needs another\n   object to perform a certain task, it directly creates or looks up the\n   dependent object.\n\n * Inversion of Control (IoC): With IoC, the control over the instantiation or\n   providing of the dependent object is moved outside the object. The base\n   module provides an interface, making the low-level module dependent on the\n   interface, rather than on a concrete implementation. A config file, a\n   factory, or a separate module is often responsible for providing the concrete\n   implementation, resulting in a more modular and flexible system.\n\n\nKEY PLAYERS IN IOC\n\n 1. IOC Container: A core mechanism that takes responsibility for instantiating,\n    maintaining, and configuring objects in an application. It leverages DI to\n    fulfill objects' required external dependencies.\n\n 2. DI: Responsible for 'injecting' these dependencies into an object when it's\n    being created, ensuring it has everything it needs to function.\n\n 3. Service Provider: A module or class responsible for instantiating and\n    managing application services or components.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING IOC CONTAINERS\n\nMany modern frameworks, such as .NET with its IServiceCollection and\nIServiceProvider, provide built-in IoC capabilities to manage Spring Beans or\nBeans in Spring Framework.\n\nHere's the .NET specific code:\n\n// ConfigureServices method in Startup.cs\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.AddTransient<IAuditService, DatabaseAuditService>();\n    services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();\n    services.AddSingleton<IMailService, SmtpMailService>();\n}\n\n\nAnd, you use IoC in the rest of your application like this:\n\npublic class UserController\n{\n    private readonly IUserService _userService;\n    private readonly IAuditService _auditService;\n\n    public UserController(IUserService userService, IAuditService auditService)\n    {\n        _userService = userService;\n        _auditService = auditService;\n    }\n\n    public void CreateOrUpdateUser(User user)\n    {\n        _userService.CreateOrUpdate(user);\n        _auditService.Log(user);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF IOC AND DEPENDENCY INJECTION\n\n * Modularity: Individual components become independent modules, minimizing\n   their interdependencies.\n\n * Flexibility: Replacement of dependencies is made simple, resulting in more\n   flexible and adaptable systems.\n\n * Unit Testing: It becomes easier to test modules in isolation as you can mock\n   or provide fake dependencies to see how they behave.","index":1,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF USING DEPENDENCY INJECTION IN A SOFTWARE\nPROJECT?","answer":"Dependency Injection (DI) offers a range of benefits that simplify software\ndevelopment and make code more modular, scalable, and flexible.\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Promotes Modular Code: DI helps in creating smaller, single-responsibility\n   classes, which ties back to the principles of SOLID design.\n\n * Easier Testing: By separating concerns, it's simpler to bimplement and carry\n   out unit tests, leading to more robust and reliable software.\n\n * Favors Interface Usage: Favoring interfaces over concrete implementations\n   encourages code that's more adaptable and can handle future changes more\n   effectively.\n\n * Clearer Code Intent: By explicitly stating the dependencies a class relies\n   on, it becomes clearer what that class does and how it uses other components.\n\n * Simplified Object Lifecycle Management: This advantage is more pronounced in\n   the context of IoC containers, where the container takes charge of the\n   objects' lifecycles.\n\n * Promotes Decoupling: DI reduces the level of interdependence between software\n   components, resulting in a system that's more flexible and easier to\n   maintain.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WITHOUT DI\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\npublic class Laptop {\n    private HardDisk hardDisk;\n    private CPU cpu;\n\n    public Laptop(){\n        this.hardDisk = new HardDisk();\n        this.cpu = new CPU();\n    }\n\n    public void bootUp() {\n        hardDisk.spin();\n        cpu.process();\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this code, both the Laptop class and the HardDisk and CPU classes are\ntightly-coupled. You cannot easily swap out HardDisk for a different component,\nit doesn't adhere to the single responsibility principle or to the \"code to an\ninterface\" principle.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WITH DI\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\npublic class Laptop {\n    private StorageDevice storageDevice;\n    private Processor processor;\n\n    // Constructor injection\n    public Laptop(StorageDevice storageDevice, Processor processor) {\n        this.storageDevice = storageDevice;\n        this.processor = processor;\n    }\n\n    public void bootUp() {\n        storageDevice.spin();\n        processor.process();\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this version, the Laptop class doesn't know the concrete types that it uses.\nInstead, it relies on the abstractions.

Decoupled code separates\nconcerns, domains, and responsibilities, which:\n\n * Simplifies Understanding: Each part of the system can be designed and\n   understood independently.\n\n * Eases Maintenance: You can update one part of the code without impacting any\n   other, reducing the chance of introducing bugs.\n\n\nMODULAR CODE FOR ENHANCED MAINTAINABILITY\n\nDI promotes modular design, where different pieces of code act as standalone,\nreusable modules known for their Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), i.e.,\none module, one responsibility.\n\n * Adherence to Best Practices: Implementing modules that are small in scope\n   with singular responsibilities reduces the need for complex, multi-threaded\n   or multi-branch operations that are harder to maintain.\n\n * Ease of Troubleshooting: Transparent module operations make identifying\n   issues and bugs more straightforward.\n\n\nCODE REUSABILITY\n\nBy breaking the system into smaller, specialized modules, DI facilitates code\nreuse. This reduces redundancy and ensures consistency in function.\n\n * Centralized Logic: Common functionalities are housed in standalone modules,\n   diminishing the possibilities of divergent implementations in various parts\n   of the codebase.\n\n\nENCOURAGING THE USE OF INTERFACES\n\nDI is best practiced using interfaces and abstract classes rather than concrete\nimplementations. This enables more straightforward substitutions (commonly\nreferred to as \"loose coupling\"). Loose coupling minimizes dependencies on\nspecific implementations, making the system more adaptable and maintainable.\n\n * Improved Flexibility: When combining several interacting objects in a system,\n   leveraging interfaces or abstract classes allows substitutes without altering\n   the reliant modules.\n\n * Streamlined Collaboration: Uniform interfaces dictate how objects are\n   expected to interact, ensuring seamless collaboration and minimizing\n   potential miscommunications.\n\n\nSIMPLIFIED TESTING\n\nDI naturally complements the concept of testing, playing a crucial role in\noptimizing and maintaining code functionality.\n\n * Enhanced Code Integrity: By substituting actual dependencies with controlled\n   or simulated ones during testing, DI makes it simpler to validate that\n   modules function correctly in varying contexts. This method of substituting\n   dependencies is called \"mocking\".\n\n * Time and Resource Efficiency: Independent testing of modules is facilitated,\n   shortening the time required to identify bugs and decreasing the likelihood\n   of dependencies between modules going undetected.\n\n\nCODE SEGREGATION FOR CLARITY\n\nDI encourages you to classify objects as services, repositories, controllers,\nand more. Each serves an organized purpose:\n\n * Clear Function Allocation: Each object has a specific task, making it easier\n   to troubleshoot and comprehend the codebase.\n   \n   * Example: In a web application, a UserController is responsible for handling\n     user-related operations, and a UserRepository is exclusively in charge of\n     database interactions related to users.\n\n\nLIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT FOR EFFICIENT RESOURCE UTILIZATION\n\nObjects within different scopes like singleton, transient or scoped are usually\nmanaged by the DI containers. Such a feature ensures efficient resource usage,\nleading to code that's easier to maintain.\n\n * Lifecycle Consistency: When all dependencies adhere to a shared lifecycle,\n   resource management is more uniform throughout the application.\n\n\nDEMANDING TRANSPARENCY AND REDUCING COMPLEXITY\n\nDI requires you to register explicit dependencies, cutting down on hidden \"magic\nbehavior.\" This transparency is critical for maintaining efficient, predictable\nmodules.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\nInterface: IMessageService.java\n\npublic interface IMessageService {\n    void sendMessage(String message);\n}\n\n\nService Class: EmailService.java\n\npublic class EmailService implements IMessageService {\n    @Override\n    public void sendMessage(String message) {\n        // Email sending logic\n        System.out.println(\"Email sent: \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\n\nConsumer: MyApplication.java\n\nHere, instead of instantiating EmailService internally, it receives the\nIMessageService through its constructor, thus being DI-compliant.\n\npublic class MyApplication {\n    private final IMessageService messageService;\n\n    public MyApplication(IMessageService messageService) {\n        this.messageService = messageService;\n    }\n\n    public void sendMessageToUser(String user, String message) {\n        // Logic to fetch user's email goes here\n        // ...\n\n        // Finally, send message using the injected service\n        messageService.sendMessage(user + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n","index":3,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM\nDEPENDENCY INJECTION?","answer":"Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and Dependency Injection are two design\nprinciples that play a pivotal role in object-oriented design. Let's explore the\nkey concepts and their concordance.\n\n\nWHAT IS DIP?\n\nThe Dependency Inversion Principle formalizes the relationship between\nhigher-level modules and lower-level modules through three key ideas:\n\n * Abstraction: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete\n   implementations.\n\n * No Concrete Dependencies: High-level modules should not be directly tied to\n   lower-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n\n * Stability: Abstractions are more stable than concrete implementations. This\n   means once defined, abstractions should seldom change, ensuring minimal\n   ripple effects in your codebase when there are changes.\n\n\nHOW DIP DIFFERS FROM DI\n\n * Abstraction vs. Relationship Management:\n   \n   * DIP: Focuses on separating the creation and management of dependencies.\n   * DI: Concentrates on providing the necessary dependencies to a class without\n     the class itself being concerned about their creation.\n\n * Direction of Dependencies:\n   \n   * DIP: Establishes a top-down relationship, stating that higher-level modules\n     should be independent of implementation details in lower-level modules.\n   * DI: Provides a mechanism for the direction of dependencies to be abstracted\n     away through various forms like constructor injection or setter injection.\n\nBRIEF LOOK AT DIP\n\n * Abstraction: Using an interface like IAuthenticationService allows the\n   AuthenticationManager to work with any concrete implementation that adheres\n   to the contract set by the interface.\n\n * No Concrete Dependencies: The AuthenticationManager is decoupled from the\n   specific AuthenticationService implementation, achieving flexibility.\n\n * Stability: By relying on IAuthenticationService, the AuthenticationManager\n   isn't affected if a new AuthenticationService or its internal mechanism is\n   introduced.\n\nBRIEF LOOK AT DI\n\nThe AuthenticationManager gets its IAuthenticationService through constructor\ninjection. An external entity, often a DI container, is responsible for\nproviding the concrete implementation, either directly or through a configured\nservice provider.\n\nThe relationship is established by:\n\npublic class AuthenticationManager {\n    private IAuthenticationService authService;\n    \n    public AuthenticationManager(IAuthenticationService authService) {\n        this.authService = authService;\n    }\n}\n\n\nWhether it's pure manual DI or using a DI framework, the idea is to have a\nseparate entity responsible for handling object creation and managing\ndependencies.\n\nThis separation of concerns aligns closely with the Dependency Inversion\nPrinciple, ensuring that high-level modules (like AuthenticationManager) are\nshielded from the volatility that might stem from changes in lower-level modules\nor their dependencies.","index":4,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nCOMPARE AND CONTRAST CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION VERSUS SETTER INJECTION.","answer":"Let's explore the key features and differences between constructor injection and\nsetter injection.\n\n\nCONSTRUCTOR INJECTION\n\nIn this method, the container creates a service object by invoking the\nconstructor and then injects it into the dependent class through the\nconstructor.\n\nConstructor injection often ensures that the dependent service is in a valid\nstate before it's ever used, and it can also help maintain the immutability of\nobjects.

It focuses on supplying\ndependencies either implicitly through configuration or explicitly using\nannotations or rules.\n\nIn contrast, a Service Locator acts as a central registry. It locates (or\n\"pulls\") services or dependencies as needed.\n\n\nLIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT\n\nWhile DI containers often cater to a variety of lifecycles, ensuring each\ndependency is available when required, a Service Locator stands neutral to\nconcerns such as when to create or dispose of objects. This responsibility then\nfalls back on the client utilizing the located service.\n\n\nCODE INTEGRITY\n\nWith a DI container, dependencies in an object are discernible either through\nthe constructor, properties, or methods. This transparency aids in compile-time\nverification and static code analysis.\n\nA Service Locator, on the other hand, might hide direct dependency\nrepresentations, instead offering a more dynamic, runtime-based approach. This\neffect could diminish code predictability and potential benefits of early error\ndetection.\n\n\nINVERSION OF CONTROL (IOC) & DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT\n\nDI containers are seen as an embodiment of Inversion of Control. They take\ncharge of creating and linking dependencies, relieving the object from its\ndirect creation responsibilities.\n\nIn contrast, a Service Locator doesn't shift control of dependencies; it\nprovides a direct method of access, allowing objects to demand their\nrequirements.\n\n\nSYSTEM INTEGRATION\n\nA well-structured DI system usually integrates with the broader context of an\napplication, setting the stage for more thorough component testing and\nseparation of concerns.\n\nThe Service Locator may not provide a clear-cut component isolation mechanism.\nIts usage might incline towards a more global mode, introducing a risk of tight\ncoupling within the application.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nFrequent usage of a Service Locator in dynamically retrieving dependencies can\npotentially lead to performance overhead compared to a pre-configured DI\ncontainer.","index":12,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"14.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU CONFIGURE DEPENDENCIES WITHIN A DI CONTAINER TYPICALLY?","answer":"In typical scenarios, you configure dependencies within a Dependency Injection\n(DI) container through one of three mechanisms: Annotation, XML, or Service\nDescriptor (such as in Angular & Spring).

This\nresults in loose coupling, which in turn greatly enhances testability.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n * Coupling: Refers to the degree of interdependence between modules or classes.\n * Cohesion: Describes the extent to which a class or a module focuses on a\n   single, well-defined task. Higher cohesion is typically desirable.\n * Testability: Refers to how easily and thoroughly an application can be\n   tested.\n * Mocking: Involves creating objects with preset dependencies, typically for\n   unit testing.\n\n\nDIRECT LINK BETWEEN DEPENDENCY INJECTION, COUPLING, AND TESTABILITY\n\nWhen a class creates its own dependencies, it results in a hard link between the\ntwo. This often leads to higher cohesion within the class but, paradoxically, to\npoorer cohesion within the system. The class handles its own needs, but it\nbecomes less flexible and adaptable to changes in its environment. This is known\nas the robustness principle, which states that \"be conservative in what you do,\nbe liberal in what you accept from others.\"\n\nIn such cases, this condition should not be met. If the necessary condition is\nmet. that means there is a hard dependence between the two objects. This means\nthat the degree of coupling is also high.\n\nOn the other hand, when a class receives its dependencies from an external\ncomponent, be it its creator, a factory, or a configuration process, it has a\nsoft dependence given that it only expects a general interface or type of a\ndependency. This is what we mean when we say a class and its dependencies are\nloosely coupled.\n\nIndicating that classes or systems are loosely coupled, or that the cohesion in\nthe system is high, will generally lead to better system flexibility,\nmaintenance, and testability.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IDENTIFYING COUPLING LEVELS\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\n// High cohesion (Has-a relationship)\nclass Wheel {\n}\n\n// Hard dependency\nclass Car {\n    private Wheel wheel = new Wheel();  // High cohesion, Hard Dependency\n}\n\n// Dependency Injection (loose coupling)\ninterface Engine {\n    void start();\n}\n\nclass ElectricEngine implements Engine {\n    public void start() {\n        // Code to start engine\n    }\n}\n\nclass GasEngine implements Engine {\n    public void start() {\n        // Code to start engine\n    }\n}\n\nclass CarDI {\n    private final Engine engine;\n    \n    public CarDI(Engine engine) {\n        this.engine = engine;\n    }\n\n    public void start() {\n        engine.start();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nPHASES OF TEST DESIGN\n\n 1.

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through a class\n    constructor.\n\n 2. Parameter Injection: Dependencies are explicitly passed through method or\n    function parameters.\n\n 3. Property/Setter Injection: Dependencies are passed through public setters or\n    properties within the class.\n\n\nDEPENDENCY INJECTION AND ITS ROLE IN MOCKING\n\nSELECTING THE MOST SUITABLE INJECTION APPROACH\n\n * Constructor Injection is advantageous for making all dependencies explicit\n   from the start, simplifying the initialization process.\n\n * Parameter Injection offers more flexibility, letting you pass dependencies as\n   required, yet it can lead to method signature proliferation.\n\n * Property/Setter Injection provides the flexibility to change dependencies at\n   runtime but can lead to hidden dependencies.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BLOG SERVICE\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\n// Constructor Injection\npublic class BlogService {\n    private final EmailService emailService;\n\n    public BlogService(EmailService emailService) {\n        this.emailService = emailService;\n    }\n\n    public void publish(Post post) {\n        // ...publish the post...\n        emailService.notifySubscribers(post);\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe blog service is thread-safe. No need to be concerned about a different\nemailService instance becoming associated during method calls.\n\n\nMOCK OBJECTS AND DEPENDENCY INJECTION IN ACTION\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n * BlogService: Uses a MailerService for emailing notifications.\n\n * EmailService: Wraps the email sending mechanism.\n\npublic class BlogService {\n    private final MailerService mailerService;\n\n    public BlogService(MailerService mailerService) {\n        this.mailerService = mailerService;\n    }\n\n    public void publishPost(Post post) {\n        mailerService.sendEmail(generateEmail(post));\n    }\n\n    private Email generateEmail(Post post) {\n        // generate email content\n        return new Email(post.getTitle(), post.getBody());\n    }\n}\n\n\nDuring testing, you can mock MailerService and verify that calling publishPost\ntriggers an email to be sent. The mailer service uses a real Email object,\nverifying the email's content without needing to test the actual email sending\nmechanism.\n\nThis setup is possible due to Dependency Injection, as you can provide a mock\nMailerService during testing that mimics email sending functionality.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF MOCK OBJECTS IN TESTING\n\n * Isolation: Each test scenario is unaffected by external dependencies or side\n   effects from other parts of the codebase.\n\n * Speed: Mocked objects typically execute more quickly than real ones,\n   improving the test suite's efficiency.\n\n * Determination: You can program mocks to behave in specific ways, ensuring the\n   test's outcome isn't reliant on external factors.","index":19,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"21.\n\n\nCAN YOU DESCRIBE A SCENARIO WHERE DEPENDENCY INJECTION MADE UNIT TESTING MORE\nCHALLENGING?","answer":"Imagine a situation where a dependency is a stateful singleton.

Singleton: A single instance is created and shared across the application.\n    This is often used for stateless services.\n\n 2. Transient: A new instance is created for each injection, ensuring each\n    dependent component has its separate instance.\n\n 3. Scoped: A new instance is created for each scope. The scope could be a unit\n    of work, an HTTP request, or any other context. The instance is then reused\n    within that scope.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: .NET CORE LIFETIME MANAGEMENT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// Registering dependencies\nservices.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, ActualService>();\nservices.AddTransient<ITransientService, ActualService>();\nservices.AddScoped<IScopedService, ActualService>();\n\npublic void SomeMethod()\n{\n    // Resolving dependencies\n    var singleton = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ISingletonService>();\n    var transient = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ITransientService>();\n    var scoped = serviceProvider.GetScopedService<IScopedService>();\n}\n\n\nCONTAINER AGNOSTICISM\n\nWhile the above example is .NET Core specific, the concept of dependency\nlifetimes is applicable across all platforms and languages.\n\nAll DI containers provide mechanisms to control dependency lifetimes.

They are designed to offer a balance between the broader\nreach of Singletons and the more limited scope of Transients.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES OF SCOPED DEPENDENCIES\n\n * Defined Lifespan: These dependencies are created once for a particular\n   context and then reused throughout the lifespan of that context. The exact\n   definition of a context can vary based on the specific DI framework being\n   used.\n\n * Concurrent Contexts: Scoped dependencies are multi-thread safe, meaning they\n   can be utilized in separate concurrent threads or requests without mixing\n   state. This is a key differentiator from Singletons, which maintain a single\n   state across the whole application.\n\n\nPRACTICAL USE CASES\n\n * Web Applications: When using a web framework, it's often beneficial to have\n   certain dependencies tied to a user's session or a specific HTTP request.\n   Scoped dependencies are perfect for this, ensuring that the same instance is\n   utilized throughout a user's session or for the duration of an HTTP request.\n\n * State Management: In applications requiring state management within specific\n   modules or layers, such as user authentication or caching, properly scoped\n   dependencies can be invaluable in maintaining clean and predictable states.\n\n * Resource Handling: Scoped dependencies are apt for managing resources with\n   limited availability, such as database connections or file handles, reducing\n   the likelihood of resource exhaustion.\n\n * Data Consistency: By sticking to a single instance of a dependency throughout\n   a context, such as a specific user's session in a web application, scoped\n   dependencies can help ensure data consistency and integrity.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SCOPED DEPENDENCY\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// Define the interface\npublic interface IScopedService\n{\n    void DoWork();\n}\n\n// Implement the interface\npublic class ScopedService : IScopedService\n{\n    public void DoWork()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Scoped Service is doing work\");\n    }\n}\n\n// In your DI container configuration for a web application using ASP .NET Core:\n\nservices.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();\n\n// In a web controller:\npublic class MyController : Controller\n{\n    private readonly IScopedService _scopedService;\n\n    public MyController(IScopedService scopedService)\n    {\n        _scopedService = scopedService;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Action()\n    {\n        // Use the scoped service in the current HTTP request context\n        _scopedService.DoWork();\n        return View();\n    }\n}\n","index":25,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"27.\n\n\nHOW DOES A DEPENDENCY INJECTION FRAMEWORK TYPICALLY RESOLVE CIRCULAR\nDEPENDENCIES?","answer":"N→MN \\rightarrow MN→M indicates that class NNN has a direct dependency on class\nMMM.\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR RESOLVING CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES\n\n 1. Setter Injection: The framework initially creates objects without\n    dependencies, then uses setter methods to inject the necessary dependencies.\n    This approach doesn't fully eliminate circular dependencies but merely\n    breaks them.\n\n 2. Interface Injection: This method is similar to Setter Injection but uses\n    interfaces instead. When a class is being instantiated, the framework passes\n    itself as a parameter to a method on the object, providing any dependencies.\n\n 3. Two-Stage Construction: The container temporarily creates objects with null\n    or placeholder values for their dependencies. Then, it fills in the real\n    dependencies and returns the completed objects.\n\n 4. Lazy Resolution: The container delays instantiating an object until it's\n    needed. This can defer components involved in a circular reference until\n    their dependencies are ready.\n\n 5.

Interfaces: Statically-typed languages use interfaces to define sets of\n    related methods or behaviors. Classes that implement these interfaces must\n    provide concrete implementations for their methods. DI, therefore, is\n    largely facilitated through interfaces.\n\n 2. Explicit Configuration: DI frameworks in these languages often require\n    explicit configuration. Components, their dependencies, and how these\n    dependencies are to be injected need to be declared either programmatically\n    or through configuration files.\n\n 3. Type Safety During Wiring: Thanks to the strong type system, the compiler in\n    these languages can help ensure type correctness during the wiring process.\n\n 4. Design Patterns: Common design patterns like the Factory Method, Abstract\n    Factory, and the more recent Service Locator have been traditionally used\n    for DI in statically-typed languages.\n\n\nDYNAMICALLY-TYPED LANGUAGES\n\nIn dynamically-typed programming languages, variable types are typically\ndetermined at runtime.\n\nMECHANISMS FOR DEPENDENCY INJECTION\n\n 1. Duck Typing: In contrast to strictly adhering to interfaces,\n    dynamically-typed languages follow the philosophy of \"duck typing\" — if an\n    object exhibits the methods (or properties) expected, it's treated as though\n    it conforms to the interface even if it doesn't implement it formally.\n\n 2. Implicit Configuration: Here, DI frameworks often embrace a policy of\n    \"convention over configuration\". The framework tries to infer how to wire\n    components based on naming conventions, or it might locate and instantiate\n    components within specific directories or modules.\n\n 3. Run-Time Effect: As types are checked during runtime, there can be greater\n    flexibility in the wiring process. Additionally, the emphasis on late\n    binding in these languages means that the actual objects to be used are\n    often determined during run-time.\n\n 4. Less Boilerplate: The absence of a strict type system translates to reduced\n    need for boilerplate code. Consequently, DI in dynamically-typed languages\n    tends to be less verbose.\n\n 5. Design Patterns: While DI frameworks in these languages do embrace several\n    design patterns (e.g., singleton, prototype), the formalism seen in\n    statically-typed languages, like the rigorous adherence to interfaces, is\n    often more relaxed.","index":31,"topic":" Dependency Injection ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"33.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF PROPERTY INJECTION IN C# AND WHERE IS IT MOST SUITABLE TO\nUSE?","answer":"Property Injection involves providing dependencies to an object through its\npublic properties.\n\nWhile the object's internal state can be modified, immediate access to\ndependencies and multiple points of mutations can lead to difficulties in\nmaintaining the application state.
