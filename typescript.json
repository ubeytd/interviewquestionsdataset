It's\n   typically best to be avoided, as it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript,\n   which is primarily focused on static typing. However, there are certain use\n   cases where it becomes necessary.\n\n * Void: Typically used as the return type for functions that don't return a\n   value.\n\n * Null and Undefined: Allow for the assignment of null and undefined values,\n   respectively. However, this isn’t enabled by default, and these are probably\n   better handled using the strict mode settings in TypeScript.\n\n * Never: Represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, the\n   return type of a function that doesn't reach its end or always throws an\n   error.\n\n * Object: Any JavaScript object.\n\n * Function: Denotes a function type.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC TYPESCRIPT TYPES\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\n// Boolean\nlet isActive: boolean = true;\n\n// Number\nlet age: number = 30;\n\n// String\nlet title: string = \"Manager\";\n\n// Array\nlet scores: number[] = [85, 90, 78];\n// or use a compact form: let scores: Array<number> = [85, 90, 78];\n\n// Tuple\nlet employee: [string, number, boolean] = ['John', 35, true];\n\n// Enum\nenum WeekDays { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday }\nlet today: WeekDays = WeekDays.Wednesday;\n\n// Any\nlet dynamicData: any = 20;\n\n// Void\nfunction greet(): void {\n  console.log(\"Hello!\");\n}\n\n// Null and Undefined\nlet data: null = null;\nlet user: undefined = undefined;\n\n// Never\nfunction errorMessage(message: string): never {\n  throw new Error(message);\n}\n\n// Object\nlet person: object = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30\n};\n\n// Function\nlet calculate: Function;\ncalculate = function (x: number, y: number): number {\n  return x + y;\n};\n","index":2,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU DECLARE VARIABLES IN TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"In TypeScript, variable declarations support different methodologies for\ndeclaring variables and their associated types.\n\n\nVARIABLE AND TYPE DECLARATION METHODS\n\n1. VAR\n\nvar score: number = 100;\n\n\nThis declaration can lead to variable hoisting and has global scope or\nfunction-level scope.\n\n2. LET\n\nUse let when you want to define variables within a block scope. This is the\nrecommended default choice:\n\nlet playerName: string = \"John\";\n\n\n3. CONST\n\nconst allows you to declare constants and is especially useful for maintaining\ndata integrity:\n\nconst apiKey: string = \"your-api-key-here\";\n\n\n4. FUNCTION SCOPE\n\nAll three methods (var, let, and const) are confined to their immediate function\nscope:\n\nfunction doSomething() {\n  let tempValue: number = 42;\n  var result: boolean = true;\n}\n\n\n\nRULES FOR VARIABLE DECLARATION AND INITIALIZATION\n\n * Order Matters: In TypeScript, a variable must be declared before being used.\n   This is not a requirement in JavaScript, but good JavaScript practice is to\n   declare a variable before using it.\n   \n   If you're dealing with complex or interconnected codes, it's a good practice\n   to use the let and const declarations that ensure the block-level scoping,\n   thus helping with potential hoisting issues.\n\n * Static Types: TypeScript requires that you declare the data type of a\n   variable (or let the system infer it) and then initialize it with a value of\n   exactly the same type:\n   \n   let count: number;  // Declaration\n   count = 42;  // Allowed\n   count = \"42\";  // Error! Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.\n   \n\n * Type Inference: TypeScript can often infer the variable's type based on its\n   initialization value. This reduces the need to specify a type explicitly.\n   \n   let word = \"hello!\";  // TypeScript infers the type as 'string' because of the initialization.\n   \n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR VARIABLE DECLARATIONS\n\n * Use const Where You Can: This approach isn't always possible, especially when\n   dealing with object properties. However, favor const for better code\n   readability and to prevent accidental data mutations.\n\n * Prefer let over var: let adheres better to block-level scoping and offers\n   more predictability in the code.\n\n * Initialize at Declaration: Although TypeScript allows initializations after\n   declarations, it's best to declare and initialize variables simultaneously to\n   improve code clarity and type safety.\n\n * Prefer Type Annotations: Explicitly specifying variable types can improve\n   code readability. However, when the variable type is obvious from the\n   initialization, type inference should suffice.","index":3,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nWHAT ARE INTERFACES IN TYPESCRIPT AND HOW DO THEY WORK?","answer":"In TypeScript, an interface defines the structure and types of its members.

It's a foundational tool to ensure type safety in\nTypeScript and a number of vital use-cases:\n\n * Reducing 'Magic Values': When ensuring readability and preventing repetitive\n   literal values, such as 1, 2, or 'red'.\n * Configuring Behaviour: influencing functionalities sets of associated values,\n   such as HTTP methods, ordering or customer types.\n * Ensuring Type Safety and Efficiency: The predefined set of valid members and\n   a clear data type ensures that value assignments and operations are\n   unequivocal and consistent.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n * Key: a unique identifier, typically a number or string.\n * Value: Data associated with the key. If not provided, the key is used as the\n   value.\n\n\nSTANDARD, STRING, AND HETEROGENEOUS ENUMS\n\n * Standard Enum: Every key and value are of the same data type, typically\n   numbers.\n * String Enum: All keys and values must be strings, ensuring consistent data\n   representation.\n * Heterogeneous Enum: Defines keys with both number or string values. However,\n   due to the mixed-type nature of these enums, it's best to steer clear of them\n   in most cases.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STANDARD ENUM\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nenum HttpMethods {\n  GET,\n  POST,\n  PUT,\n  DELETE\n}\n\nconst requestType: HttpMethods = HttpMethods.GET;\n\n// ❌ This is not allowed due to type safety\n// const requestType2: HttpMethods = 'GET';\n\n\nIn the example, the key GET is implicitly assigned the value 0.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STRING ENUM\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nenum MediaTypes {\n  Image = 'image',\n  Video = 'video',\n  Audio = 'audio'\n}\n\nconst selectedType: MediaTypes = MediaTypes.Image;\n\n// ❌ This is not allowed due to type safety\n// const selectedType2: MediaTypes = MediaTypes.Video;\n\n// ✅ Accessing the value\nconst associatedText: string = MediaTypes.Image;\n\n// ❌ This is not allowed due to type safety\n// const invalidType: MediaTypes = 'image';\n\n\nthe Enum helps ensure the proper data type and its values.\n\n\nPRAGMATIC USE OF ENUMS\n\nWhile Enums are a powerful tool for maintaining type safety, simplify\nassociating related sets of values.\n\nHowever, a consideration is that an Enum value can be inferred or forced to be\nof any key and underlying value type.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL DOWNSIDES OF ENUMS\n\n * Compilation Impact: When used in a broader context, or in data structures\n   like arrays or maps, TypeScript generates additional code to convert Enum\n   keys to their associated values.\n * Memory Usage: Every usage of an Enum requires memory allocation for its\n   value.\n\nWhen a simple constant would suffice or if there's a need for a more dynamic\nrelationship between keys and values, detailed types would be a better\nalternative.","index":5,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU DEFINE AND USE A FUNCTION IN TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"When defining a function in TypeScript, you have the following fundamental\ncomponents to consider:\n\n * Function Signature: Comprising the function's purpose, parameters, type, and\n   return value.\n * Function Body: Containing the actual operation or series of steps the\n   function will execute.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n1) FUNCTION DECLARATION\n\nTo declare a function, you specify its name, its parameter list, and its return\ntype. If the function doesn't return a value, you set the return type to void.\n\nHere is a code example:\n\nfunction greet(name: string): void {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n\n\n2) FUNCTION EXPRESSION\n\nYou can also declare functions using expressions, which involve assigning\nfunctions to variables as values. This approach allows you to be more flexible,\nsuch as when you're using callbacks.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nlet greet: (name: string) => void;\ngreet = function(name: string): void {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n};\n\n\n3) OPTIONAL AND DEFAULT PARAMETERS\n\nTypeScript supports both optional and default function parameters, enhancing the\nflexibility of your functions.\n\nOptional Parameters are denoted by a ? symbol after the parameter name.\n\nHere is the code example:\n\nfunction greet(name: string, title?: string) {\n    if (title) {\n        console.log(`Hello, ${title} ${name}!`);\n    } else {\n        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n    }\n}\n\n\nDefault Parameters are when you assign a default value to a parameter:\n\nHere is the code example:\n\nfunction greet(name = \"Stranger\") {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n\n\n4) USE REST PARAMETERS\n\nYou can define a parameter as a \"rest\" parameter, which means the function can\naccept any number of arguments for that parameter.\n\nHere is the code example:\n\nfunction introduce(greeting: string, ...names: string[]) {\n    console.log(`${greeting}, ${names.join(\", \")}!`);\n}\n\nintroduce(\"Hello\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Carol\");\n\n\n5) FUNCTION OVERLOADS\n\nYou can declare multiple function overloads to define a set of parameters and\ntheir return types for a single function. This feature is especially beneficial\nwhen the function's behavior logically varies based on different input types.\n\nHere is the code example:\n\nfunction specialGreet(name: string): void;\nfunction specialGreet(title: string, name: string): void;\n\nfunction specialGreet(a: any, b?: any): void {\n    if (b) {\n        console.log(`Hello, ${a}, ${b}`);\n    } else {\n        console.log(`Hello, ${a}`);\n    }\n}\n\n\n6) CALL SIGNATURE\n\nWhen using objects in TypeScript, you have the call signature to define the\nexpected function structure for a specific method within the object.\n\nHere is a code example:\n\ntype Greeter = {\n    (name: string): void\n};\n\nlet welcome: Greeter;\nwelcome = function(name: string): void {\n    console.log(`Welcome, ${name}!`);\n};\n","index":6,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nWHAT DOES \"TYPE INFERENCE\" MEAN IN THE CONTEXT OF TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"In TypeScript, type inference is a core feature that allows the type of a\nvariable to be automatically determined from its value. This provides the\nbenefits of static typing without the need for explicit type annotations.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nTypeScript employs a best common type algorithm to infer a variable's type. When\nTypeScript encounters multiple types for a variable during assignment or an\narray literal, it computes the union of these types and selects the best common\ntype for the variable.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TYPE INFERENCE\n\nConsider the following code:\n\nlet value = 10; // Type 'number' inferred\nlet message = \"Hello, TypeScript!\"; // Type 'string' inferred\n\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\nlet sum = add(5, 7); // Type 'number' inferred\n\n\nTypeScript can infer the most likely type from the context, such as:\n\n * When a value is assigned immediately, TypeScript assigns the value's type to\n   the variable.\n * Type information from adjacent types is used to determine the best common\n   type. If all values are of a compatible type, that type is used.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF TYPE INFERENCE\n\n * Conciseness: Eliminates the need for explicit type declarations, leading to\n   more compact and readable code.\n * Adaptability: Codebase types align naturally with values, enhancing\n   maintainability when values change.\n * Error Reduction: Reduces the risk of inconsistencies between the declared\n   type and the actual value.","index":7,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"9.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE USE OF 'LET' AND 'CONST' IN TYPESCRIPT.","answer":"TypeScript makes use of const and let for variable declaration.

HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM ES6 CLASSES?","answer":"While TypeScript and ES6 classes share many similarities, TypeScript's classes\noffer additional features and strong typing to make your code more robust.\n\n\nKEY SHARED CLASS FEATURES\n\n * Inheritance: Subclasses (children) can extend parent classes, inheriting\n   their methods and properties.\n * Polymorphism: Derived classes can define methods with the same name as their\n   parent.\n * Encapsulation: Data hiding is supported through access modifiers, such as\n   public, private, and protected.\n * Constructor: Instantiation starts with a constructor method, if defined.\n\n\nUNIQUE TYPESCRIPT CLASS FEATURES\n\nFIELD DECLARATION\n\nIn TypeScript, you can specify fields directly in the class without initializing\nthem. Automatic initialization to undefined occurs during object creation. ES6\nrequires initializing fields in the constructor or within their declaration.\n\nclass Example {\n    // Field is automatically initialized to undefined upon object creation\n    someField: string;\n}\n\n\nABSTRACT CLASSES\n\nTypeScript supports abstract classes to serve as a blueprint for other classes.\nThey cannot be instantiated on their own but can provide some implementation\nthat derived classes can override.\n\nabstract class AbstractExample {\n    abstract someMethod(): void;  // Method has no implementation (abstract)\n}\n\n\nREADONLY PROPERTIES\n\nYou can mark class properties as readonly, ensuring they are only set upon\ndeclaration or within the class constructor.\n\nclass Example {\n    readonly id: number;\n    constructor(id: number) {\n        this.id = id;  // Readonly can only be assigned in the constructor or declaration\n    }\n}\n\n\nSTATIC MEMBERS\n\nClasses in TypeScript support static members, such as properties and methods\nthat belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class.\n\nclass Example {\n    static count = 0;  // Static property\n    static incrementCount() {\n        Example.count++;\n    }\n}\n\n\nACCESSOR FUNCTIONS\n\nYou can define get and set functions in TypeScript, known as accessor functions,\nto control how class properties are accessed and modified.\n\nclass Example {\n    private _name: string;\n\n    get name(): string {\n        return this._name;\n    }\n\n    set name(newName: string) {\n        this._name = newName.trim();\n    }\n}\n\n\nPARAMETER PROPERTIES\n\nTypeScript provides a shortcut to declare a property and initialize it from the\nconstructor parameter. This method can make code more concise, especially when a\nconstructor parameter corresponds directly to a class property.\n\nclass Example {\n    constructor(private _name: string, public age: number) {\n        // Private _name property created and initialized from constructor parameter\n        // Public age property created and initialized from constructor parameter\n    }\n}\n\n\nINTERSECTION TYPES FOR CLASSES\n\nIn TypeScript, when you define a base class and then later extend it, you are\ncreating an intersection type. This means the child class will inherit all the\nproperties and methods from both its parent(s) and itself.\n\n\nES6 ADDITIONAL FEATURES NOT PRESENT IN TYPESCRIPT\n\nCLASS EXPRESSIONS\n\nBoth ES6 and TypeScript support class expressions, which allows you to define a\nclass without a class name.\n\nIn ES6:\n\nconst Animal = class {\n    // Class methods and properties defined here\n};\n\n\nITERATOR PROTOCOL\n\nES6 classes support the Iterator protocol, making it easier to iterate over\nobjects.\n\nclass IterableExample implements Iterable<string> {\n    // Implement iterator function for strings\n    [Symbol.iterator]() {\n        let index = 0;\n        const data = ['one', 'two', 'three'];\n        return {\n            next: () => {\n                if (index < data.length) {\n                    return { value: data[index++], done: false };\n                }\n                return { value: undefined, done: true };\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n","index":10,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"12.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT INHERITANCE IN TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"Let's look at how you can use inheritance in TypeScript using both ES6 classes\nand prototypal inheritance.\n\n\n1.

INHERITANCE WITH PROTOTYPAL METHODOLOGY\n\nPrior to ES6, TypeScript, like JavaScript, used a prototypal inheritance\napproach.\n\nThe prototypal mechanism can be useful when developing complex object\nstructures, but it is important to be aware of the nuances in order to avoid\nunexpected behavior.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE IN TYPESCRIPT\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\n// Define the Parent Class\nfunction Animal(this: Animal, name: string) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nAnimal.prototype.move = function(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n  console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n};\n\n// Define the Child Class\nfunction Snake(name: string) {\n  Animal.call(this, name);\n}\n\n// Set up the Inheritance\nSnake.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\nSnake.prototype.constructor = Snake;\n\n// Override the Base Type's Method\nSnake.prototype.move = function(distanceInMeters = 5) {\n  console.log(\"Slithering...\");\n  Animal.prototype.move.call(this, distanceInMeters);\n};\n\nconst mySnake = new Snake(\"Cobra\");\nmySnake.move();  // Output: Slithering... Cobra moved 5m.\n\n\nSIMPLIFIED METHODS\n\nUsing the prototypal construct can be perplexing at first, but its strength lies\nin its flexibility.\n\nYou can avoid the complexities of direct prototype assignments using ES5 derived\nconstructions, as seen next:\n\nfunction Animal(name: string) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nAnimal.prototype.move = function(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n  console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n};\n\nfunction Snake(name: string) {\n  Animal.call(this, name);\n}\n\n// Utilize `Object.create` for simplified prototype delegation\nSnake.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);\nSnake.prototype.constructor = Snake;\n\nSnake.prototype.move = function(distanceInMeters = 5) {\n  console.log(\"Slithering...\");\n  Animal.prototype.move.call(this, distanceInMeters);\n};\n","index":11,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"13.\n\n\nWHAT ARE ACCESS MODIFIERS AND HOW DO THEY WORK IN TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"Access modifiers are TypeScript's way of controlling class member visibility and\nmutability.

Let's\nhave a look at the example:\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING GETTERS AND SETTERS\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nclass Circle {\n  private _radius: number = 0;\n\n  get radius(): number {\n    return this._radius;\n  }\n\n  set radius(value: number) {\n    if (value < 0) {\n      throw new Error(\"Radius cannot be negative.\");\n    }\n    this._radius = value;\n  }\n\n  get area(): number {\n    return this.calculateArea();\n  }\n\n  private calculateArea(): number {\n    return Math.PI * this._radius ** 2;\n  }\n}\n\nconst myCircle = new Circle();\nmyCircle.radius = 5; // Invokes the 'set' method\nconsole.log(myCircle.radius); // Invokes the 'get' method\nconsole.log(myCircle.area); // Directly accesses the 'get' method\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * The Circle class has a private property _radius, which is then exposed with a\n   getter (radius) and a setter (radius).\n\n * The getter area calculates the circle's area using _radius and returns the\n   result. However, it's important to note that getters and setters aren't\n   backed by actual class members (unlike traditional properties).\n   \n   In other words, area is purely a getter, and there's no matching private\n   property like _area to back it up.\n\n * Inside the setter radius, there is a validation check to ensure that the\n   radius is not negative. If the validation fails, the method will throw an\n   exception.\n\n * Both the calling of the setter (myCircle.radius = 5) and the getter\n   (console.log(myCircle.radius)) look like regular property assignments and\n   accesses, making the code more intuitive.\n\n * The area is calculated using a private method, calculateArea(). This\n   demonstrates how getters and setters can work in concert with regular methods\n   and private members to provide a safer and more cohesive class design.\n\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n * TypeScript Support:\n   \n   * Getters and setters are fully supported in TypeScript, aligning closely\n     with how they are used in JavaScript.\n\n * Relation to Access Modifiers:\n   \n   * You can have getters and setters alongside access modifiers such as private\n     or public.\n   \n   * In the example, _radius is marked as private, and both the get and set\n     methods use this access modifier.

This\ncan be helpful in scenarios like library type definitions or automatic type\nidentification, making your code more concise and easier to maintain.\n\nLet's look at an example.\n\n\nCODE WITH TYPE INFERENCE\n\nHere is some TypeScript code:\n\nlet name = \"John\";  // TypeScript infers the type as string\nlet age = 30;       // TypeScript infers the type as number\nlet hasPets = true; // TypeScript infers the type as boolean\nlet friends = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"];  // TypeScript infers the type as string[]\n\n// Define a function\nfunction getLength(word: string): number {\n    return word.length;\n}\n\n// Get inferred types from the function\nlet len = getLength(name); // TypeScript infers 'len' as 'number'\n\n\nIn this example, TypeScript infers the types of variables name, age, hasPets,\nand friends based on their initial values. Additionally, when you invoke the\ngetLength function with the name variable, TypeScript infers the function's\nparameter type and the return type, which helps identify len as a number.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF TYPE INFERENCE\n\n * Efficient Coding: Eliminate the need for explicit type declarations in many\n   cases.\n * Maintainability: Code becomes easier to read and understand with fewer type\n   annotations. This avoids redundancy and potential mismatches between\n   annotations and variable usages.\n * Compatibility with Libraries: When integrating existing JavaScript libraries,\n   Type Inference can be particularly useful.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE TYPE INFERENCE\n\n * Quick Prototyping: When time is of the essence or for small-scale projects,\n   start with inferred types and add annotations only when necessary.\n * Working with Modern JS: As a number of modern JS constructs, like arrow\n   functions, Promises, and async/await, are typed using inference, this\n   approach can be well-matched.\n\n\nCODE WITH BREACHABLE INFERENCE\n\nLet's consider an example where Type Inference, despite its benefits, can lead\nto vulnerabilities.\n\n// Initial assignment\nlet userData = \"sensitive data\";\n\n// Later re-assignment\nuserData = 1978;  // Oops! This should not be allowed, but TypeScript inferred 'userData' as 'string' from the initial assignment.\n\n\n\nHANDLING TYPE INFERENCE BREACHES\n\n * Be Wary of any: The any type might seem like a quick fix, but it weakens the\n   safety net provided by TypeScript. It's often better to opt for exact types\n   unless there is a compelling reason to utilize any.\n * Utilize Literal Types: For constants or specific, limited value ranges,\n   employ literal types.\n * Maintain Consistency: Keeping your codebase consistent benefits from both\n   reliable inferences and clear type annotations.","index":25,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"27.\n\n\nWHAT ARE GENERICS IN TYPESCRIPT AND WHY ARE THEY USED?","answer":"Generics allow for flexible, user-defined types in TypeScript.

These decorators provide considerable flexibility and are\nparticularly useful when working with data validation and object-oriented\npatterns such as getters and setters.\n\n\nPRACTICAL USE CASES\n\n * Data Validation: Enforce constraints on data stored in class properties, such\n   as ensuring numeric fields remain within certain ranges.\n\n * Getters and Setters: Make use of accessor methods and perform custom actions\n   when properties are read from or written to.\n\n * Information Decoration: Attach and manage metadata related to class\n   properties, potentially useful for serialization or other runtime operations.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n * Decorator Factories: This technique involves defining a function that returns\n   the decorator itself. This approach allows decorators to accept parameters\n   and be used more dynamically.\n\n * Property Descriptor Object: Decorators have access to the property\n   descriptor, which contains metadata about the property, including its value\n   and presence of get and set accessors.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ENFORCING PROPERTY CONSTRAINTS\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nfunction ValidateRange(min: number, max: number) {\n    return function(target: any, propertyKey: string) {\n        let value: number;\n\n        Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {\n            get: function() { return value; },\n            set: function(newValue: number) {\n                if (newValue >= min && newValue <= max) {\n                    value = newValue;\n                } else {\n                    throw new Error(`${propertyKey} must be between ${min} and ${max}.`);\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nclass Product {\n    @ValidateRange(1, 100)\n    public productID: number;\n\n    constructor(id: number) {\n        this.productID = id;\n    }\n}\n\nlet product = new Product(105); // Throws validation error\n\n\nIn this example, the ValidateRange decorator ensures that the productID\nproperty's value remains within a specific range.

Applying Multiple Decorators: You can apply multiple decorators to the same\n    class or member, with the topmost decorator modifying the combined behavior.\n\n 2. Stacking Order and Composition: Decorators are applied in an 'inside-out'\n    manner, with the most internal decorators evaluated first.\n\n 3.

This feature, often associated with\ndecorators, allows for dynamic transformations and has applications in\nframeworks like Angular.\n\n\nWORKING WITH REFLECTION\n\nEven though TypeScript is inherently a statically typed language, it does offer\nsome basic reflection capabilities which are often leveraged by decorators.\n\nKey reflection-related elements in TypeScript include:\n\n * Types: Defined via the typeof operator.\n * Metadata: Additional contextual information, especially useful for things\n   like decorators. This can be obtained through the 'Reflect' API.\n\n\nDECORATORS IN TYPESCRIPT\n\nIntroduced in TypeScript 1.5, decorators provide a way to annotate and modify\nclasses and class members, like methods and properties, at design time.\n\nDecorators are functions that are invoked with either:\n\n * The constructor function of the class being decorated (for class decorators)\n * The target of the member being decorated and the property name (for method\n   and property decorators)\n * Or the target of the static member and the property name (for static method\n   and static property decorators).\n\nThe decorator for a method receives the constructor target and the method name,\nalong with a property descriptor object.\n\nSimilarly, decorators for properties receive the same constructor target and the\nproper name, along with an optional symbol to get the object's symbol\ndescription. If a descriptor is required, the decorator function receives a\nProperty Descriptor.\n\n\nREFLECT\n\nThe Reflect object provides a series of utility functions and methods for\nexamining and altering the properties or methods of objects. It acts as a more\nfunctional and less imperative counterpart to other reflection mechanisms like\nthose based on Object.getOwnPropertyNames and similar functions.\n\nHere are a few Reflect methods:\n\n * Reflect.getPrototypeOf(obj): This method is an equivalent of the\n   obj.__proto__ property.\n\n * Reflect.ownKeys(obj): It returns all keys of the provided object, including\n   its own enumerable and non-enumerable properties and symbols explicitly\n   defined on the object. It omits inherited properties.\n\n * Reflect.get(obj, key): This method is a way to retrieve the value of the\n   property of the object it is invoked on, using a more functional style rather\n   than the traditional property access.\n\n * Reflect.set(obj, key, value): This is a more functional-style approach to\n   assigning a value to the property of an object, serving as an alternative to\n   the direct = assignment.\n\n * Reflect.deleteProperty(obj, key): It can delete properties from an object and\n   returns a boolean value indicating whether the property was deleted\n   successfully.\n\n * Reflect.has(obj, key): It checks whether an object has a property and, if the\n   property is not enumerable, it'll always return false.","index":51,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"53.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF 'TSCONFIG.JSON'.","answer":"The purpose of a tsconfig.json file is to consolidate TypeScript options and\nsettings for a project into a single, consistent file.\n\n\nKEY BENEFITS\n\n * Simplify Compilation: Reduces the need for repetitive command-line options,\n   particularly beneficial for projects with complex setups.\n * Enhanced IDE Support: Standardizes build configurations across team members\n   and enables stronger tooling integration with Visual Studio, WebStorm, and\n   other IDEs.\n * Improved Source Control: Streamlines version control by maintaining a single\n   file for TypeScript settings and options.\n\n\nCOMMON OPTIONS\n\nCOMPILEROPTIONS\n\nSpecifies compiler settings such as:\n\n * target: ECMAScript version for output files.\n * module: Module format.\n * strict: Enforces strict language rules.\n\nINCLUDE AND EXCLUDE\n\nSpecifies files or directories to include in or exclude from the compilation.\n\nEXTENDS\n\nEnables the inheritance of settings from another tsconfig.json file.\n\nFILES AND REFERENCES\n\nSpecifies individual files or sets of references to aid in the compilation\nprocess.\n\nTYPES\n\nFor the automatic inclusion of type declaration packages from @types and other\ntype providers.\n\nTYPEROOTS AND TYPES\n\nFor controlling where type declaration packages are loaded from, and specifying\ntypes to include respectively.\n\nLIB\n\nSpecifies which default library files to include.\n\nPATHS AND BASEURL\n\nFacilitate the use of path mappings in module imports.\n\nOUTDIR, ROOTDIR, AND COMPOSITE\n\nFor handling output and code structure during compilation.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Encourage Consistency: Use the same set of options across a project or\n   organization to establish a uniform development experience.\n * Version Control: It is advisable to add tsconfig.json to version control to\n   ensure consistent builds across environments.\n\n\nSYNTHESIZED EXAMPLE: 'TSCONFIG.JSON'\n\nHere is a simple tsconfig.json file:\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"strict\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tests/*.ts\"]\n}\n","index":52,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"54.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE FILES IN COMPILATION USING 'TSCONFIG.JSON'?","answer":"The tsconfig.json file allows you to customize TypeScript's compilation\nbehavior, including file inclusions and exclusions.\n\n\nCOMPILER OPTIONS RELATED TO FILE SETS\n\n * include: This setting catalogs the files and directories to compile.

This focuses mainly on return types and\nfunction parameters.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\nAt first glance, allowing TypeScript to assign the any type implicitly might\nseem convenient, especially when a variable's type is uncertain. However, this\napproach has its drawbacks:\n\n * Reduced Safety: Relinquishing control to any dilutes the strong typing\n   benefits TypeScript brings.\n * Potentially Unchecked Errors: While TypeScript offers extensive\n   type-checking, any bypasses this process, possibly introducing bugs.\n * Readability Concerns: Code becomes less expressive and harder to understand,\n   particularly for team-based projects.\n\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLE\n\nConsider a scenario without noImplicitAny:\n\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b; // TypeScript silently infers 'any' for both 'a' and 'b'\n}\n\n\nIn this setting:\n\n * TypeScript won't issue a warning, allowing the function to use + (string\n   concatenation) inadvertently on a and b if provided as strings.\n * Any external caller might not realize the function's reliance on a and b's\n   types during development.\n\nBut when noImplicitAny is enabled, TypeScript provides valuable feedback:\n\n// Sample Error without noImplicitAny\n//   parameter 'a' implicitly has an 'any' type.\n//   parameter 'b' implicitly has an 'any' type.\n//   'any' could be instantiated with a non-object type.\nfunction add(a, b) { ... }\n\n\n\nPROPER PARAMETER TYPE ANNOTATION\n\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) {\n  return a + b; // Typing issue (with or without noImplicitAny)\n}\n\n\nBy specifying types for the a and b parameters, you signal the expected input,\nmaking the function safer to use and more understandable to others.\n\n\nMORE CONTEXT\n\nWhile noImplicitAny focuses on parameter and return typing, TypeScripts' error\nfor implicit any is broad in scope, encompassing general variable declarations:\n\nlet x; // Implicitly 'any'\n\n\nand member access operations:\n\nlet user = {\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  age: 22\n};\n\n// This will raise an error under `noImplicitAny`\nlet strLength = user.name.length; // 'name' implicitly has an 'any' type.\n\n// To avoid the error, use explicit typing:\nlet strLength: number = user.name.length;\n\n\n\nSTRIKE A BALANCE\n\nFor evolving projects or when integrating third-party code, it mightn't always\nbe practical to eliminate any outright. In such cases, you can selectively opt\nout:\n\n// @ts-ignore\nsomeFunctionThatUsesAny();\n\n\nHowever, it's crucial to exercise this flexibility judiciously, using it only\nwhen genuinely necessary.","index":57,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"59.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU ENABLE STRICT NULL CHECKS IN TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"Let's take a look at strict null checks and how you can enable them in\nTypeScript for improved reliability in your code.\n\n\nENABLING STRICT NULL CHECKS\n\nYou can enable strict null checks using two distinct but related flags in the\ntsconfig.json file.\n\n * The strict flag acts as a master control, enabling all strict type checking\n   options.\n * The strictNullChecks flag, when enabled, specifically focuses on null and\n   undefined values, making sure that they are handled properly.\n\nHere's what those entries might look like in your tsconfig.json file:\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNOTABLE FEATURES\n\nEnabling strict null checks offers several advantageous features:\n\n * Improved Code robustness: Helps prevent common bugs and errors related to\n   unexpected null or undefined values.\n * More Descriptive Types: null and undefined are no longer silently tolerated\n   by other types, providing more explicit type information.\n * Non-Nullable Types: Variables can automatically be inferred as non-nullable\n   when initialized during declaration or assignment, unless explicitly marked\n   as potentially nullable.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nWhen enabled, strict null checks might make your codebase feel more 'picky' at\nfirst. However, this approach positively affects robustness in the long term.\n\n * Expect More Warnings: The TypeScript compiler will be stringent in spotting\n   any potential null pointer or undefined errors.\n * Type Compatibility: It ensures that types are handled more precisely.\n\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLE\n\nLet's see how enabling strict null checks can lead to a safer code:\n\nWithout strict null checks:\n\nlet username: string;\nlet errorMessage: string;\n\nif (!username) {\n  errorMessage = \"Username is required.\";\n}\n\n\nHere, the errorMessage might end up with the string \"Username is required.\" even\nif username is defined but falsy (null, undefined, \"\").\n\nWith strict null checks:\n\nlet username: string;\nlet errorMessage: string;\n\nif (!username) {\n  errorMessage = \"Username is required.\";\n  // Type Error: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'string | null | undefined'.\n  //   Property 'length' does not exist on type 'null'.\n  console.log(username.length); // Potential error is caught!\n}\n\n\nThe strict null check setting of TypeScript also provides a more precise\nunderstanding of the variable's type.

By setting it to true, you can\n   bypass checking definition files.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * External Type Packages: For libraries that don't bundle type definitions, or\n   third-party declarations, opt for @types or npm install @types/your-package.\n\n * Library-Supplied Definitions: If the library features built-in type\n   information, a manual declaration setup might be best.\n\n * Custom Definition Files: For libraries without available type definitions,\n   generate custom ones or craft manual .d.ts files.\n\n * Triple-Slash Directives: Employ these directives to reference external\n   definitions within your TypeScript files.\n\n/// <reference types=\"node\" />\n\n\n * Type Inference: Leverage TypeScript's ability for type inference when\n   feasible. For instance, when importing a library such as Lodash without\n   explicit type definitions, TypeScript will infere types. However, it's\n   prudent to rely on type definitions wherever possible to ensure codebase\n   correctness and editor enhancements.","index":59,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"61.\n\n\nWHAT IS DEFINITELYTYPED AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO TYPESCRIPT?","answer":"DefinitelyTyped is a formidable repository on GitHub housing type definitions\nfor over 300,000 JavaScript libraries, making it an invaluable resource for\nTypeScript developers looking to incorporate existing JS codebases into their\nprojects.\n\nDevelopers are encouraged to culminate type definitions for third-party\nlibraries without types—referred to as \"untyped libraries\"—when using\nTypeScript. Once these definitions have been established, they can be made\npublicly available, contributing to the cohesion and consensus of the global\nTypeScript community.\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\n * Dependencies and Collaboration: Unlike other global repositories, such as\n   npm, DefinitelyTyped isn't directly linked to npm packages. This means that\n   once a type definition has been contributed from DefinitelyTyped, it doesn't\n   rely on third-party collaboration to keep up to date.\n\n * Verification Process: As with any community-driven initiative, contributions\n   to DefinitelyTyped are reviewed carefully to ensure accuracy, consistency,\n   and quality. Meticulous checks are in place to guarantee the resilience and\n   suitability of these type definitions before they're made available.\n\n * Usage Globally with tsd, etc.: While tsd is a package manager service for\n   type definitions, and typings is a tool to manage the typing files, they have\n   different dependency management mechanisms in place.","index":60,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"62.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW TO USE TYPING FILES FROM NPM.","answer":"Typing files from NPM, also known as @types packages, enable TypeScript to\nunderstand non-TS modules and provide accurate type checking.\n\n\nWORKING WITH TYPING FILES\n\n 1. Check for Pre-existing Types: Before defining custom types, verify if the\n    library already has official type definitions. Many popular NPM packages\n    have corresponding @types packages, providing comprehensive type\n    definitions. If available, install them directly.\n\n 2. Installation: TypeScript installs typings automatically for @types packages.\n    For non-scoped packages, the installation package format is npm install\n    -save-dev @types/packageName. For scoped packages, use npm install -save-dev\n    @types/scope__packageName.\n\n 3. Automatic Lookup: Modern TypeScript versions can recognize type definitions\n    for NPM packages. When a package is referenced in the code, TypeScript\n    consults its package.json file to find the associated @types package and\n    installs it.\n\n 4. Manual Typings Association: If the automatic lookup fails, you can link\n    packages to their type definitions using package.json. In the \"types\" or\n    \"typings\" field, specify the path to the typings file or the main module\n    with its type definitions.\n    \n    For example:\n    \n    {\n      \"name\": \"myPackage\",\n      \"types\": \"path-to-types-package/index.d.ts\"\n    }\n    \n\n 5. Fallback for Missing Definitions: In case a package does not offer type\n    definitions, TypeScript defaults to declare module 'module-name';. While\n    this approach forgoes compile-time type checking, it enables you to use\n    3rd-party libraries and plugins. If possible, consider contributing to a\n    shared type definition repository like DefinitelyTyped to improve the\n    ecosystem.\n\n 6. Reuse and Improvement of Existing Types: As you use and potentially extend\n    existing type definitions, contribute back to the community. This\n    collaborative effort benefits everyone, ensuring high-quality type\n    definitions that reflect the latest package versions.","index":61,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"63.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU INTEGRATE TYPESCRIPT WITH ANGULAR?","answer":"Integrating TypeScript with Angular enables you to use a strongly-typed\nlanguage, offering clearer syntax and improved tooling support.\n\n\nKEY BENEFITS\n\n * Type Safety: TypeScript catches errors at compile time.\n * Modern Features: ES6 and beyond features are supported, ensuring code\n   consistency.\n * Tooling: Features like code completion and refactoring are available.\n\n\nINTEGRATING TYPESCRIPT WITH ANGULAR\n\nINITIATING A PROJECT WITH ANGULAR AND TYPESCRIPT\n\nUse Angular CLI for bootstrapping applications, specifying TypeScript during the\nsetup:\n\nng new my-angular-app --defaults --language=typescript\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\nMODULES AND DECORATORS\n\n * NgModule: TypeScript's decorators like @NgModule streamline Angular module\n   definition.\n\n * Component: Decorators like @Component enable declaring components with clear\n   metadata.\n\nDEFINING TYPES\n\n * Interface: TypeScript interfaces define contracts between different parts of\n   your app. They're especially useful in Angular Services.\n\n * Type Aliases: Sometimes, you may want to give a type a different name.

Start with modular code, and expand\n   when necessary.\n\n * Separation of Concerns: Each part of the app should have a clear, defined\n   role.\n\n * Single Responsibility Principle: Each module should be responsible for one\n   task.\n\n\nCOMMON TECHNIQUES\n\nNAMESPACE VS. MODULE VS. PACKAGE\n\n * Namespace (Internal Module): Useful for smaller projects; can lead to code\n   organization challenges when utilized excessively.\n * Module (External Module): Encourages reusability and clean code,\n   automatically avoiding common pitfalls like variable/functional naming\n   conflicts. Ideal for larger projects and third-party libraries.\n * Package: Uses a combination of modules to form a distribution mechanism;\n   efficient for sharing code between different projects.\n\nLAZY LOADING\n\n * Using module loaders like SystemJS or Webpack: This can help minimize the\n   initial load time by loading JavaScript files only when needed. This is\n   especially useful for applications with a large number of modules or those\n   that might not be used frequently.\n\nSEPARATION OF CONFIGURATION\n\n * Configuration Files: Store project configuration in separate files like\n   tsconfig.json and package.json.\n\n * Environment Settings: Use different configurations for development, testing,\n   and production, like using environment variables. There are tools to simplify\n   this process, such as dotenv or system configuration.\n\nUSING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES\n\n * AST Toolkits such as ts-morph: These can be used to parse and analyze\n   TypeScript code and to make automatic code adjustments in a structured\n   manner. This can be useful for large projects when needing to make\n   large-scale code adjustments in a safe, structured manner.\n\n\nCODE AND FOLDER STRUCTURE\n\nLAYERED ARCHITECTURE\n\n * Presentation Domain Data Layers: Segregate code for clear roles and\n   responsibilities.

One of the most popular choices is Jest, but others like\nMocha and Chai are also common.\n\n\nGUIDELINES FOR UNIT TESTING\n\n * Testing Framework: Choose at least one testing framework (like Mocha) and an\n   assertion library that works well with TypeScript.\n\n * Writer's Note: Using a Testing Library (@testing-library/react, for example)\n   in conjunction with Jest can optimize test creation and testing approach.\n   However, it doesn't work with all projects.\n\n * Test Runner: The test platform, like Jest, is responsible for executing test\n   cases and providing a test environment.\n\n * Type Coverage: Tools like ts-jest and Jest can ensure better type coverage by\n   setting them up in a TypeScript project.\n\n * Configuration File: Establish a unique way to run tests, as detailed in\n   package.json. With Jest, an additional setup file jest.config.js facilitates\n   specific configurations, such as environment settings, globs, or coverage.\n\n * Utility Libraries: Employ other relevant libraries such as sinon for spies or\n   mocks, or faker for creating sample data.\n\n * Coverage Reporting: Ensure visibility into which portions of the codebase are\n   under test through built-in mechanisms or tools such as Istanbul and the\n   coveralls package.\n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FOR CERTAIN FRAMEWORKS\n\n * Mocha: It encompasses a versatile suite of testing tools and allows\n   developers to cherry-pick their preferred assertion library, such as chai or\n   should. While it facilitates the use of test frameworks, employing additional\n   ones like Jasmine or QUnit might lessen the extent of Mocha's capabilities.\n\n * Chai: Prominent for its readability and flexibility, Chai lets developers\n   pick from various assertion styles. \"Should\" offers a BDD style, \"Expect\"\n   focuses on asserting expectations, and \"Assert\" opts for a TDD approach.\n\nAll these individual libraries have a general appeal due to their mechanism of\nvisually showcasing discrepancies while integrating seamlessly with numerous\ntesting frameworks.\n\n\nKEY STEPS IN WRITING UNIT TESTS\n\n 1. Design Test Scenarios: Create descriptions of the anticipated behavior in\n    individual test cases.\n\n 2.

Express simplifies this process using\nspecialized functions.\n\nHere is the sample:\n\nimport express from \"express\";\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\n\ninterface Product {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  price: number;\n}\n\nconst products: Product[] = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: \"Product 1\",\n    price: 99.99,\n  },\n];\n\napp.get(\"/products\", (req, res) => {\n  res.json(products);\n});\n\napp.get(\"/products/:id\", (req, res) => {\n  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const product = products.find((p) => p.id === id);\n\n  if (product) {\n    res.json(product);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).send();\n  }\n});\n\napp.post(\"/products\", (req, res) => {\n  const { id, name, price } = req.body;\n\n  if (!id || !name || !price) {\n    res.status(400).send();\n  }\n\n  const newProduct: Product = {\n    id,\n    name,\n    price,\n  };\n\n  products.push(newProduct);\n  res.status(201).json(newProduct);\n});\n\napp.put(\"/products/:id\", (req, res) => {\n  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = products.findIndex((p) => p.id === id);\n\n  if (index !== -1) {\n    products[index] = { ...req.body, id };\n    res.json(products[index]);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).send();\n  }\n});\n\napp.delete(\"/products/:id\", (req, res) => {\n  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const index = products.findIndex((p) => p.id === id);\n\n  if (index !== -1) {\n    products.splice(index, 1);\n    res.status(204).send();\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).send();\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () =>\n  console.log(\"Server is running at http://localhost:3000\")\n);\n\n\n\nHANDLING DATA AND PERSISTENCE\n\nKeeping up with best practices in TypeScript, data entities can be represented\nusing classes. They make the data easier to manage and are a natural fit for\nobject-oriented workflows.\n\nHere is the sample code:\n\nclass Product {\n  static _id = 1;\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  price: number;\n\n  constructor(name: string, price: number) {\n    this.id = Product._id++;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.price = price;\n  }\n}\n\nconst products: Product[] = [new Product(\"Sample Product\", 99.99)];\n\n\n\nVALIDATING INPUTS\n\nEnsuring data integrity is critical for a robust service. TypeScript offers\nfeatures like interfaces and type assertions for reliable data validation.\n\nHere is the sample code:\n\napp.post(\"/products\", (req, res) => {\n  const { name, price } = req.body;\n\n  if (!name || !price) {\n    res.status(400).send();\n  }\n\n  const parsedPrice = parseFloat(price);\n  if (isNaN(parsedPrice)) {\n    res.status(400).send();\n  }\n\n  const newProduct = new Product(name, parsedPrice);\n  products.push(newProduct);\n  res.status(201).json(newProduct);\n});\n\n\n\nHANDLING ERRORS\n\nExpress middleware streamlines error handling. You can use it to validate\nrequest data and provides dynamic error messages.\n\nHere is the sample code:\n\nconst validateProduct = (req: express.Request, res: express.Response, next: express.NextFunction) => {\n  const { name, price } = req.body;\n\n  if (!name || !price) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Name and price are required' });\n  }\n\n  const parsedPrice = parseFloat(price);\n  if (isNaN(parsedPrice)) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Price must be a number' });\n  }\n\n  next();\n};\n\napp.post(\"/products\", validateProduct, (req, res) => {\n  // ... code for adding a product\n});\n\n\n\nUSING MIDDLEWARE FOR COMMON TASKS\n\nMiddleware can extend Express with common code. An example is body parsing,\nwhich makes incoming request data accessible through req.body.\n\nHere is the code:\n\nimport express from \"express\";\nimport cors from \"cors\";\nimport helmet from \"helmet\";\nimport { validateProduct, parsePrice } from \"./middleware\";\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(helmet());\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }) );\n\napp.post(\"/products\", parsePrice, validateProduct, (req, res) => {\n  // ... code for adding a product\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () =>\n  console.log(\"Server is running at http://localhost:3000\")\n);\n","index":79,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"81.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW TO HANDLE DATA MODELING IN A TYPESCRIPT BACKEND.","answer":"Data modeling in a TypeScript backend involves defining schemas and employing\nORMs or ODMs.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Domain and Use-Case Specificity: Custom-tailor models to your application's\n   specific requirements.\n\n * Consistency Across Tiers: Ensure the uniformity of models across the client,\n   server, and database tiers.\n\n * Encryption and Validation: Implement security measures and data integrity\n   checks at the model level.\n\n\nCORE MODELING COMPONENTS\n\n 1.

These ORM\ntools bridge the gap between your relational database and your TypeScript code.\n\n\nTYPEORM OR SEQUELIZE SETUP\n\n 1. Install Required Packages: Use npm or yarn to install TypeORM or Sequelize.\n    \n    With npm:\n    \n    npm install typeorm reflect-metadata mysql\n    \n\n 2. Configure TypeORM or Sequelize: Set up the config file, often named\n    ormconfig.json, to specify the database connection details.\n    \n    A MySQL example for TypeORM might look like:\n    \n    {\n      \"type\": \"mysql\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost\",\n      \"port\": 3306,\n      \"username\": \"root\",\n      \"password\": \"password\",\n      \"database\": \"test\",\n      \"entities\": [\"src/entity/**/*.ts\"],\n      \"synchronize\": true\n    }\n    \n\n\nUSING TYPEORM\n\n 1. Setup tsconfig.json: Enable \"emitDecoratorMetadata\" and\n    \"experimentalDecorators\" under compilerOptions for TypeORM decorators to\n    function.\n    \n    Your tsconfig.json might look like this:\n    \n    {\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n 2.

Interact with Database: You can perform database operations using methods\n    like save(), find(), and remove() on your entities.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    const newUser = new User();\n    newUser.name = 'John Doe';\n    await connection.manager.save(newUser);\n    \n    const allUsers = await connection.manager.find(User);\n    \n\n\nUSING SEQUELIZE\n\n 1. Setup the Database Connection: Use the Sequelize class to establish a\n    connection.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    const sequelize = new Sequelize('test', 'root', 'password', {\n      host: 'localhost',\n      dialect: 'mysql'\n    });\n    \n\n 2. Model Definitions: Define your database tables using Sequelize's data types.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    const User = sequelize.define('user', {\n      id: {\n        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        autoIncrement: true\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: DataTypes.STRING,\n        allowNull: false\n      }\n    });\n    \n    // Synchronize the model with the database\n    User.sync();\n    \n\n 3. Interact with Database: Use methods like create(), findAll(), and destroy()\n    to perform database operations.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    await User.create({ name: 'John Doe' });\n    const allUsers = await User.findAll();\n    ","index":81,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"83.\n\n\nDISCUSS AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION STRATEGIES IN TYPESCRIPT APIS.","answer":"Authentication and authorization are core components of secure applications.\nWhile focusing on TypeScript APIs, we'll explore the different methods for\nhandling user identity, including shared keys and session management. We'll then\ntouch upon the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms as well.\n\n\nPRIMARY CONCEPTS\n\nAUTHENTICATION\n\n * Shared Key: A pre-defined key is issued to both client and server, usually\n   for machine-to-machine communication.\n\n * Token: Typically JSON Web Token (JWT), which is versatile and can encapsulate\n   specific claims.\n\nAUTHORIZATION\n\n * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles, and access to\n   resources is defined based on these roles.\n\n * Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Access to resources is determined by\n   evaluating a set of attributes or policies.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: AUTHENTICATING WITH JWT\n\nHere is how you implement the JWT Authentication Strategy in TypeScript:\n\nimport jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Authentication Middleware\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];\n  if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Access Denied');\n\n  try {\n    const verified = jwt.verify(token, 'jwtSecret');\n    req.user = verified; // Once verified, attach user info to the request object\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(400).send('Invalid Token');\n  }\n});\n\n// Authenticated Endpoint\napp.get('/api/me', (req, res) => {\n  res.send(req.user); // Returns the user who sent the JWT\n});\n\n// Login Endpoint\napp.post('/auth/login', (req, res) => {\n  const user = { id: 1, username: 'testUser' }; // Simulate user lookup\n  const token = jwt.sign({ user }, 'jwtSecret');\n  res.send(token);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));\n\n\nIn this code example, JWTs are employed for ensuring secure access to endpoints.\nA Token Enums dictionary is used to define the action type.

This backward compatibility allows\n   for gradual adoption of newer language features.\n\n * Proposals Integration: The TypeScript team closely monitors evolving\n   ECMAScript proposals. They make these features available to developers, often\n   with a \"downlevel emit\" strategy ensuring the generated JavaScript remains\n   compatible with previous ECMAScript versions.\n\n\nESNEXT AND DOWNLEVEL EMIT\n\nTypeScript's suite of tools, including the transpiler, employs a strategy called\n\"Downlevel Emit\", to ensure code generated from TypeScript adheres to earlier\nECMAScript versions. This technique enables developers to access newer\nECMAScript features while not breaking compatibility with older environments and\nbrowsers.\n\nILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE: ASYNC FUNCTION WITH DOWNLEVEL EMIT\n\nConsider the following TypeScript code, utilizing an \"async function\":\n\nasync function fetchAndDisplay() {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  displayData(data);\n}\n\n\nWhen utilizing Downlevel Emit and targeting ECMAScript 5, TypeScript transforms\nthe asynchronous await operation using a generator:\n\nfunction fetchAndDisplay_1() {\n    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function* () {\n        var data;\n        return __generator(this, function (_a) {\n            switch (_a.label) {\n                case 0: return [4, fetchData()];\n                case 1:\n                    data = _a.sent();\n                    displayData(data);\n                    return [2];\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n\nUsing the __awaiter and __generator utilities, TypeScript orchestrates\nasynchronous operations in a way that's compatible with ECMAScript 5.\n\nTYPESCRIPT CONFIGURATION: DOWNLEVEL ETHEREUM\n\nTo specify the targeted JavaScript version and enable Downlevel Emit, you can\nset the target property in the tsconfig.json file:\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES5\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, setting target to \"ES5\" directs the TypeScript compiler to\nproduce JavaScript code aligning with the ECMAScript 5 standard.\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nTypeScript's commitment to standards ensures that developers can embrace new\nECMAScript features, from in-progress proposals to officially ratified ones, all\nwhile maintaining compatibility with earlier versions.

This method is new and asynchronous version of\nSymbol.iterator for handling asynchronous iterators and is tailored to be used\nwith for-await-of loop.\n\nWhen you implement Symbol.asyncIterator, the returned async iterator object must\ncontain an async next method that retrieves the next item in the sequence.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING SYMBOL.ASYNCITERATOR\n\nHere is the TypeScript code example:\n\nconst delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\nconst asyncIterable: { [Symbol.asyncIterator](): AsyncIterableIterator<number> } = {\n    async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {\n        for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {\n            await delay(1000);\n            yield i;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n(async () => {\n    for await (const num of asyncIterable) {\n        console.log(num);\n    }\n})();\n","index":88,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"90.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF A TYPESCRIPT APPLICATION?","answer":"TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, shares its best performance\npractices. Here are ways to optimize the performance of TypeScript applications.\n\n\nCODE PROCESSING\n\n * Transpile as Needed: Only transpile TypeScript sources when necessary. The\n   transpilation process can be quite resource-intensive, so focusing\n   transpilation on the code that's been updated can be a significant\n   optimization.\n\n * Lazy Loading: Bootstrap your application's main module before loading any\n   others. Components and modules should be loaded dynamically, as needed.\n\n\nFILE MANAGEMENT\n\n * Bundle Files: For production, bundle files to minimize HTTP requests. This\n   technique ensures all necessary files are fetched in a single go, enhancing\n   loading speed.\n\n * Tree Shaking: Utilize tree shaking with tools like Webpack, which\n   mechanically removes unused code. This process guarantees only essential code\n   is bundled, thereby reducing the application size.\n\n\nCODE DESIGN\n\n * Avoid Over-Architecting: While modularity is essential, an overly complex\n   architecture results in performance overheads. Simplify wherever possible.\n\n * Multiple Small Functions: Breakdown tasks into smaller functions. This makes\n   it easier for JavaScript engines to optimize your code during early stages of\n   optimization, resulting in faster code.\n\n\nTOOLS AND SERVICES\n\n * Minify Code: In your production builds, always minify the JavaScript. This\n   action shortens the names of functions and variables, shrinking file sizes.\n\n * Use Ahead-of-Time Compilation: Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation tests the\n   application's various components before even the execution process starts;\n   and if any issues are found then the errors are displayed, making the\n   development process faster.\n\n * Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Utilize a CD hosting your JavaScript if\n   your customers are distributed throughout the globe. This boosts the speed of\n   certain international users.\n\n\nDATA\n\n * Data Handling: For data-heavy applications, be cautious with bulk data\n   operations. Process this data in smaller chunks using paginations or batch\n   processing.\n\n * Data Compression: On the network level, deploy techniques like Data\n   compression to lessen data traffic, notably useful for transmitting JSON or\n   XML over HTTP.\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n * Reduce HTTP Requests: Opt for modern frameworks/libraries and config settings\n   to merge and compress components, lessening the count of HTTP requests and\n   hence the loading time.\n\n * Use LocalStorage: For particular kinds of cache, such as non-volatile user\n   data, try using LocalStorage to minimize server roundtrips.\n\n * HTTP2/3: As optimal, serve your application over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to benefit\n   from several of their performance-boosting features including, multiplexing.\n\n\nRENDERING PERFORMANCE\n\n * Virtual Scrolling: In lists and grids, employ virtual scrolling to display\n   only what's needed, rather than everything at once.\n\n * CSS & Layout Optimization: Be attentive with CSS, so the browser doesn’t have\n   to frequently recompute layout and styles, a cause of performance lags. This\n   is more relevant to large single-page applications (SPAs) that contain\n   crucial performance architecture.\n\n * Server-Side Rendering: If your application doesn't restrict it, see if\n   server-side rendering suits your application and can noticeably improve the\n   first render time.\n\n\nCACHING\n\n * Use Client-Side Caching: Where appropriate, cache data on the client-side to\n   avoid redundant server requests. This is particularly useful for static\n   contents.\n\n * Opt for Time-bound Caching: Set precise time thresholds for cached contents,\n   ensuring they don't become outdated but persist long enough for frequent\n   usage.\n\n * Health Checks: Use cache health checks to ensure data is up-to-date and\n   cleared when necessary.\n\n\nIMAGES AND MULTIMEDIA\n\n * Lazy Load Images: Utilize lazy loading for media content, so they don't load\n   unless required, shortening the initial site loading time.\n\n * Image Compression: Use compressed images to make them lightweight without\n   compromising quality.\n\n\nTHIRD-PARTY PLUGINS\n\n * Limited Usage: Third-party plugins and libraries can often be slower than\n   in-house solutions due to size, network requests, or other factors. Minimize\n   their usage if possible and always ensure they're trusted.\n\n * Performance-Tailored Libraries: Whenever possible, choose third-party\n   solutions deliberately optimized for performance.\n\n\nCODE VERIFICATION\n\n * Analyze Code: Regularly analyze your codebase for any elements that might\n   lead to performance bottlenecks. This practice is especially crucial with\n   ever-evolving applications.\n\n * UI Responsiveness: Keep an eye on your application's User Interface (UI)\n   responsiveness, making sure it feels snappy and operates with appropriate\n   speed.\n\n\nTEST AND MEASURE\n\n * Performance Monitor: Take advantage of browser performance monitoring tools →\n   provided by Chrome DevTools, for example, to track and enhance your\n   applications' performance.\n\n * Lighthouse Audit: This is a tool that can analyze your website or web\n   application and deliver insight into its performance details. Keep in mind\n   that some web applications can be quite labor-intensive, and fulfilling all\n   of the recommendations won't be practically possible.","index":89,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"91.\n\n\nDISCUSS TREE SHAKING IN TYPESCRIPT.","answer":"Tree shaking is a technique used by bundlers, such as Webpack or Rollup, to\neliminate unused code from a project before deployment.\n\nIt is especially critical in large codebases to keep bundle sizes optimized.\n\nWhen a module is tree-shaken, the bundler ensures that any functions, classes,\nor variables within that module that are never imported or used in the project\nas a whole are discarded.\n\n\nMECHANISM\n\n 1. Static Analysis: By inspecting import statements and the dependency graph,\n    the bundler can discern which modules are in use.\n\n 2. Marking for Deletion: Functions, classes, or variables that aren't directly\n    or indirectly used within the project are tagged for removal from the\n    bundle.\n\n 3. Unglobbing: The bundler disentangles objects and removes their non-exported\n    parts.\n\n 4. Minification: The resulting code is often minified to further reduce size.\n\n\nFUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS\n\n * ES2015 Modules: Tree shaking is most effective with ES2015 modules and static\n   import syntax.\n\n * Pure Functions and Side Effects: Tree shaking leverages the concept of pure\n   functions, which depend only on their inputs and have no side effects.\n\n * Long-Range and Short-Range Chains: Tree shaking can eliminate parts of a\n   chain of function calls or method invocations that isn't accessed, offering\n   finer control.\n\n * Dynamic Import Caveat: Modules that are dynamically imported, for example\n   using import() or through require() in node, pose tree shaking challenges.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BASIC TREE SHAKING\n\nHere is the code:\n\n// math.ts\nexport function square(x: number): number {\n  return x * x;\n}\n\nexport function cube(x: number): number {\n  return x * x * x;\n}\n\n// index.ts\nimport { square } from './math';\n\nconsole.log(square(5));\n\n// bundle.js after tree shaking\n// Everything related to cube would be shaken off.\n\n// Transpiled ES5\n// tree-shakable directory structure\n// └─ tree-shakable\n//    ├─ index.ts\n//    └─ math.ts\n// bundle.js\n// └─ \"use strict\";\n//    var r=require(\"./math\");console.log(r.square(5));\n\n\nIn this example, only the square function from math.ts is used in index.ts.

Boundaries are further defined through export\nstatements and import declarations.\n\nHowever, developers might still encounter larger bundle sizes than they\nanticipate. This can be caused by features like tree-shaking not functioning as\nexpected in certain contexts, or due to the inclusion of unnecessary TypeScript\ncode in the final bundle.\n\n\nKEY STRATEGIES FOR BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION\n\n 1. Effective Use of Module Import-Export Mechanisms: Use both default and named\n    exports in TypeScript code judiciously. Named exports enable cherry-picking\n    specific elements from imported modules, reducing the risk of unnecessary\n    inclusions.\n\n 2. Selective Import: Instead of import * as Module from 'module';, be\n    selective: import { specificExport } from 'module';.\n\n 3. Minimize Circular Dependencies: These can hinder tree-shaking capabilities.\n\n 4. Limit Type-Only Imports/Exports: Enhanced in TypeScript 3.8, using import\n    type or export type eliminates imports/exports of types at runtime, aiding\n    in reducing size.\n\n 5. Conserve DOM Manipulations: For web environments, using TypeScript's DOM and\n    HTMLElement types can be quite heavy, particularly when targeting older\n    browsers.\n\nSometimes, even after following these strategies, your bundle may still include\nunnecessary code, leading to a larger than expected size. In such cases, the use\nof tools such as Bundle Phobia or Webpack Analyzer can help identify potentially\nredundant code or dependencies.

A pivotal\nadvance came with the introduction of conditional types, addressing several\nlimitations of the traditional extends-based mechanisms.\n\n\nCONDITIONAL TYPES AND INFER\n\nInference in TypeScript is closely linked to conditional types. At its core, a\nconditional type evaluates to one of two types based on whether a type parameter\nholds a given structure.\n\nThe keyword infer, disjoint from the regular conditional logic, hooks into the\ntype parameter inference flow and marks positions where TypeScript should infer\ntypes explicitly. It's often employed within conditional types to capture types\nand direct them towards specific paths.\n\nConsider the following illustrative example:\n\ntype ParamType<T> = T extends (param: infer P) => any ? P : never;\n\n\nThe presence of infer in the context of the generic type parameter T alerts the\nTypeScript compiler to anticipate inferred types for P found in the type's\n\"right-hand side.\" In this case, if T is a function type expecting a single\nparameter, ParamType<T> extracts the parameter type of that function.\n\nPRIOR TO INFER\n\nBefore the emergence of infer and conditional types, inference in TypeScript was\noften an all-or-nothing proposition. Paradoxically, TypeScript commonly provided\neither too much information, leading to restrictive type inferences, or too\nlittle, causing inefficiencies and potential type errors. This inflexibility\nfrequently manifested when attempting to infer types from generic contexts.\n\nConsider the simplified Filter type, where the parameter T might be inferred\nmore precisely within the type's definition:\n\ntype Filter<T, U> = T extends U ? T : never;\n\n\nBefore the induction of infer, the syntax for the constrained conditional\nexpression within Filter was less intuitive, sometimes necessitating clever type\nmanipulation to induce the desired inference.\n\nWIDER CONTEXT\n\nInference and conditional types are integral components of type expression\nmechanisms in the TypeScript type checker. The real-world utility of these\nadvanced features is impressive, enhancing the developer's ability to model\ncomplex structures within TypeScript's type system. Whether it's filtering types\nbased on predicates or simulating control structures, the introduction of infer\npronouncedly extended TypeScript's capabilities in such scenarios, offering\nenhanced safety and error detection.","index":94,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"96.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE USE OF LABELED TUPLE ELEMENTS?","answer":"Labeled tuple elements, introduced in TypeScript 4.0, are a compelling feature\nfor structuring and type-checking data containers such as classes.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Improved Readability: Descriptive keys ensure that the tuple's purpose and\n   structure are self-evident.\n * Enhanced Context: Enables you to discern the role of each tuple element based\n   on the label, enhancing the clarity of your data structures.\n * Refactoring Flexibility: You can modify the order or drop nonessential\n   elements confidently, with the type system providing guardrails.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LABELED TUPLE ELEMENTS\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\n// Define a labeled tuple type\ntype LabeledPerson = [id: number, name: string, isActive: boolean];\n\n// Initialize a labeled tuple\nlet person: LabeledPerson = [1, 'Alice', true];\n\n// Each element can be accessed by its label or index\nconst id: number = person.id;\nconst name: string = person[1];\nconst isActive: boolean = person[2];\n\n// Labeled tuples are particularly useful in functions\nfunction updatePerson(newData: LabeledPerson): void {\n  const [id, name, isActive] = newData;  // Variables now have easily identifiable meanings\n  // Perform updates...\n}\n\n\nIn this example, the LabeledPerson typing serves as a clear and self-documenting\ncontainer for storing data pertaining to a person.","index":95,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"97.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE TYPESCRIPT COMMUNITY OR TYPESCRIPT ITSELF?","answer":"There are numerous ways you can contribute to the TypeScript community and even\nto the development of TypeScript itself.\n\n\nCODE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n * Bug Fixes: Identifying and fixing existing bugs.\n * Feature Additions: Contributing new language or tooling features.\n\n\nTESTING AND VALIDATION\n\n * Code Testing: Ensuring your changes are compatible and do not introduce new\n   issues.\n * Early Adoption: Volunteering your project to use preliminary TypeScript\n   builds, providing valuable feedback before official releases.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION UPDATES\n\n * Enhancements: Improving the official TypeScript documentation by adding\n   examples, clarifications, or additional resources.\n\n\nISSUE MANAGEMENT\n\n * Issue Triage: Reproducing, clarifying, or identifying patterns in reported\n   bugs or requests.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n\n * Code Review: Helping validate and improve others' contributions.\n * User Support: Providing assistance on forums, GitHub, or other platforms\n   where TypeScript is discussed.\n * Blog Contributions: Writing about TypeScript use-cases, good practices, or\n   even your contributions.\n * User Group Leadership: Organizing and leading local TypeScript meetups and\n   user groups.\n\n\nACADEMIC OR RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n * Language Research: Bringing in academic insights or research findings for\n   potential language improvements.\n\n\nDEVELOPER TOOLING AND FRAMEWORKS\n\n * TypeScript Support: Offering support or enhancements for popular development\n   tools, frameworks, or libraries that integrate with TypeScript.","index":96,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"98.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE ROLE OF TYPESCRIPT IN OPEN-SOURCE DEVELOPMENT.","answer":"TypeScript's role in open-source development is multi-faceted and vital.

Install TypeScript: Obtain TypeScript using npm or Visual Studio, after\n     which you can verify the installation and version using tsc -v.\n\n 2.  Convert JavaScript to TypeScript incrementally: Begin this process by\n     either renaming .js files to .ts or using tsc --init to create a\n     tsconfig.json file.\n\n 3.  Leverage tsconfig.json: This file customizes TypeScript's behavior,\n     offering controls over various features, type-checking, and compilation.\n     Set compilerOptions such as \"target\", \"module\", \"strict\", and \"jsx\" to\n     align with your project's requirements.\n\n 4.  Use Type Declarations: Effectively incorporate external libraries with\n     their respective type definitions, which provides type safety. After adding\n     required type files as dependencies, your tsconfig.json will include\n     \"types\": [...], assuring only specified libraries and their typings are\n     included.\n\n 5.  Benefit from any Type: Initially, use any type to nullify TypeScript's type\n     checks on specific variables or parts of the codebase.\n\n 6.  The never Type: Simplify your code and remove unreachable sections via\n     explicit \"never\" type usage.\n\n 7.  Focus on Core Types: Concentrate on the fundamental types available in\n     TypeScript such as boolean, number, string, and object.\n\n 8.  Narrow Down Types: Utilize null and undefined in better ways by discerning\n     their specific types.\n\n 9.  Accommodate Undefinedness: Employ non-null assertion operator or\n     TypeScript's strictNullChecks to handle the potential presence of null\n     values.\n\n 10. Employ Type Assertions Marketedly: When you are confident about a value's\n     type despite what TypeScript understands, use type assertions like as\n     string.\n\n 11. Use Enums and Symbol Types: Enhance code clarity and restrict data\n     representations by employing enum and symbol types.\n\n 12. Manipulate Union Types: Capture a variety of related types by employing\n     union types that service variables with multiple permissible value types.\n\n 13. Leverage Type Guards: Write custom functions or use predefined\n     functionality like typeof that confirms variables' types during runtime.\n\n 14. Apply Literal Types: Make type declarations more precise and esteem\n     readability using literal types like strings and numbers.\n\n 15. Employ Rest Parameters Assertively: Employ the ... syntax to characterize\n     an indefinite enumeration of parameters with the same type.\n\n 16. Opt for Limited Property Modes: With readonly and unique, minimize\n     accidental data manipulations and enforce distinct value assignments.\n\n 17. Be Mindful of Interfaces and Exhaustiveness: Sync potential object property\n     keys using index signatures and seal objects with known properties by\n     marking them \"read-only.\"\n\n 18. Distinct Type Declarations via declare: Use d.ts files to establish\n     JavaScript modules' types when there are no TS file types available.\n\n 19. Eliminate Duplicates with noUnusedLocals: Safeguard against variable\n     redundancy using this TypeScript feature.\n\n 20. Tightly Control Module Usage: With \"module\" options like \"amd,\" \"es2015,\"\n     or \"esnext,\" specify the module systems you authorize. filename through\n     \"fileName.\"\n\n 21. Streamline Build Outputs: Specify the compilation target to make sure only\n     the necessary files are generated.\n\n 22. Validate TypeScript Configurations: Use tsc -p somePath to meticulously\n     evaluate configurations within defined directories, ensuring a complete\n     understanding of the established settings.\n\nIncluding these elements in your codebase will result in more effective type\nchecking coverage and robust TypeScript integration.","index":99,"topic":" TypeScript ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
