[{"text":"1.\n\n\nWHAT IS A MICROSERVICE AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM A MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE?","answer":"Microservices and monolithic architecture are two distinct software design\nparadigms, each with its unique traits.\n\nA monolithic architecture consolidates all software components into a single\nprogram, whereas a microservices architecture divides the application into\nseparate, self-contained services.\n\nMicroservices offer several advantages but also have their own challenges,\nrequiring careful consideration in the software design process.\n\n\nKEY DIFFERENCES\n\n * Decomposition: Monolithic applications are not easily separable, housing all\n   functionality in a single codebase. Microservices are modular, each\n   responsible for a specific set of tasks.\n\n * Deployment Unit: The entire monolithic application is packaged and deployed\n   as a single unit. In contrast, microservices are deployed individually.\n\n * Communication: In a monolith, modules communicate through in-process calls.\n   Microservices use standard communication protocols like HTTP/REST or message\n   brokers.\n\n * Data Management: A monolith typically has a single database, whereas\n   microservices may use multiple databases.\n\n * Scaling: Monoliths scale by replicating the entire application. Microservices\n   enable fine-grained scaling, allowing specific parts to scale independently.\n\n * Technology Stack: While a monolithic app often uses a single technology\n   stack, microservices can employ a diverse set of technologies.\n\n * Development Team: Monoliths can be developed by a single team, whereas\n   microservices are often the domain of distributed teams.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE MICROSERVICES\n\nMicroservices are advantageous for certain types of projects:\n\n * Complex Systems: They are beneficial when developing complex,\n   business-critical applications where modularity is crucial.\n\n * Scalability: If you anticipate varying scaling needs across different\n   functions or services, microservices might be the best pick.\n\n * Technology Diversification: When specific functions are better suited to\n   certain technologies or when you want to use the best tools for unique tasks.\n\n * Autonomous Teams: For bigger organizations with multiple teams that need to\n   work independently.","index":0,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nCAN YOU DESCRIBE THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE?","answer":"Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a\ncollection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service is self-contained,\nfocused on a specific business goal, and can be developed, deployed, and\nmaintained independently.\n\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES OF MICROSERVICES\n\nCODEBASE & INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE\n\nEach microservice manages its own codebase and data storage. It uses its own\nindependent infrastructure, ranging from the number of virtual machines to\npersistence layers, messaging systems, or even data models.\n\nANTIFRAGILITY\n\nMicroservices, instead of resisting failure, respond to it favorably. They\nself-adapt and become more resilient in the face of breakdowns.\n\nOWNERSHIP\n\nDevelopment teams are responsible for the entire lifecycle of their respective\nmicroservices - from development and testing to deployment, updates, and\nscaling.\n\nDESIGN FOR FAILURE\n\nMicroservices are built to anticipate and handle failures at various levels,\nensuring the graceful degradation of the system.\n\nDECENTRALIZATION\n\nServices are autonomous, making their own decisions without requiring\noverarching governance. This agility permits independent deployments and ensures\nthat changes in one service do not disrupt others.\n\nBUILT AROUND BUSINESS CAPABILITY\n\nEach service is crafted to provide specific and well-defined business\ncapabilities. This focus increases development speed and makes it easier to\ncomprehend and maintain the system.\n\nSERVICE COUPLING\n\nServices are related through well-defined contracts, mainly acting as providers\nof specific functionalities. This reduces dependencies and integration\nchallenges.\n\nDIRECTED TRANSPARENCY\n\nEach service exposes a well-defined API, sharing only the necessary information.\nTeams can independently choose the best technology stack, avoiding the need for\na one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AUTOMATION\n\nDeployments, scaling, and configuration undergo automation, preserving\ndevelopment velocity and freeing teams from manual, error-prone tasks.\n\nORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT\n\nTeams are structured around services, aligning with Conway's Law to support the\nMicroservices architecture and promote efficiency.\n\nCONTINUOUS SMALL REVISIONS\n\nServices are frequently and iteratively improved, aiming for continual\nenhancement over major, infrequent overhauls.\n\nDISCOVERABILITY\n\nServices make their features, capabilities, and interfaces discoverable via\nwell-documented APIs, fostering an environment of interoperability.\n\n\nTHE \"DEVOPS\" CONNECTION\n\nThe DevOps method for software development merges software development (Dev)\nwith software operation (Ops). It focuses on shortening the system's software\ndevelopment life cycle and providing consistent delivery. The \"you build it, you\nrun it\" approach, where developers are also responsible for operating their\nsoftware in production, is often associated with both Microservices and DevOps.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: LOAN APPROVAL MICROSERVICE\n\nHere is the sample Java code:\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/loan\")\npublic class LoanService {\n    @Autowired\n    private CreditCheckService creditCheckService;\n\n    @PostMapping(\"/apply\")\n    public ResponseEntity<String> applyForLoan(@RequestBody Customer customer) {\n        if(creditCheckService.isEligible(customer))\n            return ResponseEntity.ok(\"Congratulations!

SCALABILITY\n\nEach microservice can be scaled independently, which is particularly valuable in\ndynamic, going-viral, or resource-intensive scenarios.\n\n2. FLEXIBILITY\n\nDecoupling services means one service's issues or updates generally won't affect\nothers, promoting agility.\n\n3. TECHNOLOGY DIVERSITY\n\nDifferent services can be built using varied languages or frameworks. While this\nadds some complexity, it allows for best-tool-for-the-job selection.\n\n4. IMPROVED FAULT TOLERANCE\n\nIf a microservice fails, it ideally doesn't bring down the entire system, making\nthe system more resilient.\n\n5.

Data relationships and consistency\n   might be hard to maintain.\n\n * Eventual Consistency: Different microservices could be using data that might\n   not be instantly synchronized. Dealing with eventual consistency can raise\n   complications in some scenarios.\n\n\nSERVICE COMMUNICATION\n\n * Service Synchronization: Maintaining a synchronous communication between\n   numerous services can result in a more tightly coupled and less scalable\n   architecture.\n\n * Service Discovery: As the number of services grows, discovering and properly\n   routing requests to the appropriate service becomes more challenging.\n\n\nSECURITY AND ACCESS CONTROL\n\n * Decentralized Security: Implementing consistent security measures, such as\n   access control and authentication, across all microservices can be intricate.\n\n * Externalized Authorization: When security-related decisions are taken outside\n   the service, coherent and efficient integration is crucial.\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT\n\n * Server Deployment: Managing numerous server deployments entails additional\n   overhead and might increase the risk of discrepancies among them.\n\n * Monitoring Complexity: With each microservice operating independently,\n   gauging the collective functionality of the system necessitates more\n   extensive monitoring capabilities.\n\n\nBUSINESS LOGIC DISTRIBUTION\n\n * Domain and Data Coupling: Microservices, especially those representing\n   different business domains, may find it challenging to process complex\n   business transactions that require data and logic from several services.\n\n * Cross-Cutting Concerns Duplication: Ensuring a uniform application of\n   cross-cutting concerns like logging or caching across microservices is\n   non-trivial.\n\n\nSCALABILITY\n\n * Fine-Grained Scalability: While microservices allow selective scale-up,\n   guaranteeing uniform performance across varying scales might be troublesome.\n\n * Service Bottlenecks: Certain services might be hit more frequently,\n   potentially becoming bottlenecks.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND TESTING\n\n * Integration Testing: Interactions between numerous microservices in\n   real-world scenarios might be challenging to replicate in testing\n   environments.\n\n\nCONSISTENCY AND ATOMICITY\n\n * System-Wide Transactions: Ensuring atomic operations across multiple\n   microservices is complex and might conflict with certain microservice\n   principles.\n\n * Data Integrity: Without a centralized database, governing data integrity\n   could be more intricate, especially for related sets of data that multiple\n   microservices handle.\n\n\nCHALLENGES IN UPDATING AND VERSIONING\n\n * Deployment Orchestration: Coordinated updates or rollbacks, particularly in\n   hybrid environments, can present difficulties.\n\n * Version Compatibility: Assuring that multiple, potentially\n   differently-versioned microservices can still work together smoothly.\n\n\nTEAM STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT\n\n * Siloed Teams: Without a unified architectural vision or seamless\n   communication, different teams developing diverse microservices might make\n   decisions that are not entirely compatible with the overall system.\n\n * Documentation and Onboarding: With an extensive number of microservices,\n   their functionalities, interfaces, and usage need to be well-documented for\n   efficient onboarding and upkeep.","index":3,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nHOW DO MICROSERVICES COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER?","answer":"Microservices often work together, and they need efficient communication\nmechanisms...\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION PATTERNS\n\n * Synchronous: Web services and RESTful APIs synchronize requests and\n   responses. They are simpler to implement but can lead to tighter coupling\n   between services. For dynamic traffic or workflow-specific requests, this is\n   a suitable choice.\n\n * Asynchronous: Even with service unavailability or high loads, queues lead to\n   the delivery of messages. The services do not communicate or interact beyond\n   their immediate responsibilities and workloads. For unpredictable or lengthy\n   processes, use asynchronous communication.\n\n * Data Streaming: For continuous data needs or applications that work with\n   high-frequency data, such as stock prices or real-time analytics, this method\n   is highly effective. Kafka or AWS Kinesis are examples of this pattern.\n\n\nINTER-SERVICE COMMUNICATION METHODS\n\n 1. RESTful APIs: Simple and clean, they utilize HTTP's request-response\n    mechanism. Ideal for stateless, cacheable, and stateless resource\n    interactions.\n\n 2. Messaging: Deploys a message broker whereby services use HTTP or a messaging\n    protocol (like AMQP or MQTT). This approach offers decoupling, and the\n    broker ensures message delivery. Common tools include RabbitMQ, Apache\n    Kafka, or AWS SQS.\n\n 3. Service Mesh and Sidecars: A sidecar proxy, typically running in a\n    container, works alongside each service. They assist in monitoring, load\n    balancing, and authorization.\n\n 4. Remote Procedure Call (RPC): It involves a client and server where the\n    client sends requests to the server with a defined set of parameters.\n    They're efficient but not perfectly decoupled.\n\n 5. Event-Based Communication: Here, services interact by producing and\n    consuming events. A service can publish events into a shared event bus, and\n    other services can subscribe to these events and act accordingly. This\n    pattern supports decoupling and scalability. Common tools include Apache\n    Kafka, AWS SNS, and GCP Pub/Sub.\n\n 6. Database per Service: It involves each microservice owning and managing its\n    database. If a service A needs data from service B, it uses B's API to\n    retrieve or manipulate data.\n\n 7. API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for services and consumers.\n    Netscaler, HAProxy, and Kong are popular API Gateway tools.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REST API\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nimport requests\n\n# Make a GET request to receive a list of users.\nresponse = requests.get('https://my-api/users')\nusers = response.json()\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: GRPC\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Import the generated server and client classes.\nimport users_pb2\nimport users_pb2_grpc\n\n# Create a gRPC channel and a stub.\nchannel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051')\nstub = users_pb2_grpc.UserStub(channel)\n\n# Call the remote procedure.\nresponse = stub.GetUsers(users_pb2.UserRequest())\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT MICROSERVICES?\n\n * Ease of Development: If you need to onboard a large number of developers or\n   have strict timelines, RESTful APIs are often easier to work with.\n\n * Performance: gRPC and other RPC approaches are superior to RESTful APIs in\n   terms of speed, making them ideal when performance is paramount.\n\n * Type Safety: gRPC, due to its use of Protocol Buffers, ensures better type\n   safety at the cost of being slightly less human-readable when compared to\n   RESTful JSON payloads.\n\n * Portability: RESTful APIs, being HTTP-based, are more portable across\n   platforms and languages. On the other hand, gRPC is tailored more towards\n   microservices built with Protobufs.","index":4,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nWHAT IS DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN (DDD) AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO MICROSERVICES?","answer":"Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides a model for designing and structuring\nmicroservices around specific business domains.

These boundaries help microservice\nteams to operate autonomously, evolving their services within a set context.\n\n\nUBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE\n\nUbiquitous Language is a shared vocabulary that unites developers and domain\nexperts. Microservices within a Bounded Context are built around this common\nlanguage, facilitating clear communication and a deeper domain understanding.\n\n\nSTRONG CONSISTENCY AND RELATIONAL DATABASES\n\nWithin a Bounded Context, microservices share a consistent data model, often\ndealing with strong consistency and using relational databases. This cohesion\nsimplifies integrity checks and data relationships.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\n 1.

This process\nallows for greater development agility, flexibility, and often better\nscalability.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Microservices should be independently deployable\n    and manageable pieces of the application, typically built around distinct\n    business areas or domains.\n\n 2. Database Strategy: Each microservice should have its own data storage, but\n    for ease of data access and management, it's beneficial for microservices to\n    share a database when practical.\n\n 3. Communication: The microservices should interact with each other in a\n    well-coordinated manner. Two common models are Direct communication via HTTP\n    APIs or using events for asynchronous communication.\n\n\nSTEPS TO DECOMPOSE\n\n 1. Identify Domains: Break down the application into major business areas or\n    domains.\n 2. Data Segregation: Determine the entities and relationships within each\n    microservice. Use techniques like database-per-service or shared-database.\n 3. Service Boundary: Define the boundaries of each microservice - what data and\n    functionality does it control?\n 4. Define Contracts: Intelligently design the APIs or events used for\n    communication between microservices.\n 5. Decouple Services: The services should be loosely coupled, to the maximum\n    extent possible. This is especially important in scenarios where you have\n    independent development teams working on the various microservices.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DECOMPOSITION WITH DDD\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"product\")\npublic class Product {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long id;\n    private String name;\n    private double price;\n    //...\n}\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"order_item\")\npublic class OrderItem {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long id;\n    private Long productId;\n    private Integer quantity;\n    private double price;\n    //...\n}\n\npublic interface OrderService {\n    Order createOrder(String customerId, List<OrderItem> items);\n    List<Order> getOrdersForCustomer(String customerId);\n    //...\n}\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/orders\")\npublic class OrderController {\n    //...\n    @PostMapping(\"/\")\n    public ResponseEntity<?> createOrder(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> order) {\n        //...\n    }\n    //...\n}\n\n\nIn this example, a Product microservice could manage products and expose its\nservices through RESTful endpoints, and an Order microservice could manage\norders.

However, there are both traditional and modern strategies\nto handle multi-service transactions, each with its own benefits and trade-offs.\n\n\nTRADITIONAL APPROACHES\n\nTWO-PHASE COMMIT (2PC)\n\nTwo-Phase Commit is a transaction management protocol in which a global\ncoordinator communicates with all participating services to ensure that the\ntransaction can either be committed globally or rolled back across all involved\nservices.\n\nWhile it offers transactional integrity, 2PC has seen reduced popularity due to\nits potential for blocking scenarios, performance overhead, and the difficulties\nassociated with its management in distributed ecosystems.\n\nTHREE-PHASE COMMIT (3PC)\n\nA direct evolution of the 2PC model, 3PC provides a more robust alternative. By\nincorporating an extra phase, it tries to overcome some of the drawbacks of 2PC,\nsuch as the potential for indefinite blocking.\n\nWhile 3PC is an improvement over 2PC in this regard, it's not without its\ncomplexities and can still introduce performance penalties and maintenance\noverhead.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL OUTBOX\n\nThe Transactional Outbox pattern involves using messaging systems as a mechanism\nto coordinate transactions across multiple microservices. In this approach:\n\n 1. The primary DB records changes in the outbox.\n 2. An event message is added to a message broker.\n 3. Subscribers read the message and execute the corresponding local\n    transaction.\n\nTransactional outbox offers high decoupling but does not provide the same level\nof strong consistency as the previous pattern.\n\nSAGA PATTERN\n\nDerived from the Greek word for a \"long, epic poem,\" a saga is a sequence of\nlocal transactions, each initiated within a microservice. In a distributed\nsetting, a saga is a coordination mechanism between these local transactions,\naiming for eventual consistency.\n\nWith SAGA, you trade immediate consistency for long-term consistency. If\nsomething goes wrong during the saga, you need to define a strategy for\ncompensation actions to bring the overall system back to a consistent state,\nhence the \"epic journey\" metaphor.\n\n\nMODERN APPROACHES\n\nACKNOWLEDGED UNRELIABILITY\n\nThe philosophy here is one of embracing a partially reliable set of distributed\nsystems. Instead of trying to guarantee strong consistency across services, the\nfocus is on managing and mitigating inconsistencies and failures through robust\nservice designs and effective monitoring.\n\nDDD AND BOUNDED CONTEXTS\n\nWhen microservices are designed using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), each\nmicroservice focuses on a specific business domain, or \"Bounded Context.\" By\ndoing so, services tend to be more independent, leading to fewer cross-service\ntransactions in the first place.\n\nThis approach promotes a strong focus on clear service boundaries and effective\ncommunication and collaboration between the stakeholders who understand those\nboundaries and the associated service behavior.\n\nCQRS AND EVENT SOURCING\n\nThe Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern involves separating\nread and write operations. This clear separation of concerns reduces the need\nfor cross-service transactions.\n\nWith Event Sourcing, each state change is represented as an event, providing a\nreliable mechanism to propagate changes to multiple services in an asynchronous\nand non-blocking manner.\n\nWhat is crucial here is that the proliferation of these patterns and concepts in\nmodern software and system design is a direct result of the unique needs and\nopportunities presented by new paradigms such as microservices. Instead of\nretrofitting old ways of thinking into a new environment, the focus is on\nadapting notions of consistency and reliability to the realities of modern,\ndecentralized, and highly dynamic systems.","index":7,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"9.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF 'BOUNDED CONTEXT' IN THE MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE.","answer":"In the context of microservices architecture, the principle of \"Bounded Context\"\nemphasizes the need to segment a complex business domain into distinct and\nmanageable sections.\n\nIt suggests a partitioning based on business context and clearly defined\nresponsibilities to enable individual teams to develop and manage independent\nmicroservices.\n\n\nCORE CONCEPTS\n\nUBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE\n\n * Each microservice and its bounded context must have a clearly defined \"domain\n   language\" that is comprehensible to all the members of the team and aligns\n   with the business context.\n\nCONTEXT BOUNDARIES\n\n * A bounded context delineates the scope within which a particular model or\n   concept is operating, ensuring that the model is consistent and meaningful\n   within that context.\n\n * It establishes clear boundaries, acting as a bridge between domain models, so\n   that inside the context a specific language or model is used.\n\n * For instance: in the context of a customer, it might use a notion of \"sales\n   leads\" to represent potential customers, while in the context of sales, it\n   would define leads as initial contact or interest in a product.\n\nDATA CONSISTENCY\n\n * The data consistency and integrity is local to the bounded context. Each\n   context's data is safeguarded using transactions, and data is only propagated\n   carefully to other contexts to which it has a relationship.\n\n * It ensures that the understanding of data by each service or bounded context\n   is relevant and up-to-date.\n   \n   Example: In an e-commerce system, the product catalog context is responsible\n   for maintaining product data consistency.\n\nTEAMS & AUTONOMY\n\nEach bounded context is maintained and evolved by a specific team responsible\nfor understanding the business logic, making it self-governing and allowing\nteams to work independently without needing to understand the logic of other\ncontexts.\n\nRELATIONSHIP WITH SOURCE CODE\n\n * The concept of a bounded context is implemented and realized within the\n   source code using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

Consequently, a failure in one of the\nservices can have downstream effects, potentially leading to system-wide\nfailure. To address this, several best practices and resilience mechanisms are\nimplemented.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR HANDLING FAILURE\n\nFAULT ISOLATION\n\n * Circuit Breaker Pattern: Implement a circuit breaker that isolates the\n   failing service from the rest of the system. This way, the failure doesn't\n   propagate and affect other services.\n\n * Bulkhead Pattern: Use resource pools and set limits on the resources each\n   service can consume. This limits the impact of failure, ensuring that it\n   doesn't exhaust the whole system's resources.\n\nERROR RECOVERY\n\n * Retry Strategy: Implement a retry mechanism that enables services to recover\n   from transient errors. However, it's important to determine the maximum limit\n   and backoff policies during retries to prevent overload.\n\n * Failsafe Services: Set up backup systems so that essential functionalities\n   are not lost. For example, while one service is down, you can temporarily\n   switch to a reduced-functionality mode or data backup to avoid complete\n   system failure.\n\n\nRESILIENCE MECHANISMS\n\nAUTO-SCALING\n\n * Resource Reallocation: Implement auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources\n   based on load and performance metrics, ensuring the system is capable of\n   handling the current demand.\n\nDATA INTEGRITY\n\n * Eventual Consistency: In asynchronous communication between services, strive\n   for eventual consistency of data to keep services decoupled. This ensures\n   data integrity is maintained even when a service is temporarily unavailable.\n\n * Transaction Management: Use a two-phase commit mechanism to ensure atomicity\n   of transactions across multiple microservices. However, this approach can\n   introduce performance bottlenecks.\n\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT\n\n * Data Redundancy: Introduce redundancy (data duplication) in services that\n   need access to the same data, ensuring data availability if one of the\n   services fails.\n\n * Caching: Implement data caching to reduce the frequency of data requests,\n   thereby lessening the impact of failure in the data source.\n\n * Data Sharding: Distribute data across multiple databases or data stores in a\n   partitioned manner. This reduces the risk of data loss due to a single point\n   of failure, such as a database server outage.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\n * Versioning: Maintain backward compatibility using API versioning. This\n   ensures that services can communicate with older versions if the newer one is\n   experiencing issues.\n\n * Message Queues: Decouple services using a message queuing system, which can\n   help with load leveling and buffering of traffic to handle temporary\n   fluctuations in demand.\n\n * Health Checks: Regularly monitor the health of microservices to identify and\n   isolate services that are malfunctioning or underperforming.\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR HANDLING FAILURE\n\n * Self-Healing Components: Develop microservices capable of self-diagnosing and\n   recovering from transient faults, decreasing reliance on external mechanisms\n   for recovery.\n\n * Graceful Degradation: When a service fails or becomes overloaded, gracefully\n   degrade the quality of service provided to users.\n\n * Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor all microservices and alert teams in\n   real-time when there is a deviation from the expected behavior.\n\n * Failure Isolation: Localize and contain the impact of failures, and provide\n   backup operations and data whenever possible to provide ongoing service.","index":9,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"11.\n\n\nWHAT DESIGN PATTERNS ARE COMMONLY USED IN MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURES?","answer":"Several design patterns lend themselves well to microservices architectures,\noffering best practices in their design and implementation.\n\n\nCOMMON DESIGN PATTERNS\n\n * API Gateway: A single entry point for clients, responsible for routing\n   requests to the appropriate microservice.\n\n * Circuit Breaker: A fault-tolerance pattern that automatically switches from a\n   failing service to a fallback to prevent service cascading failures.\n\n * Service Registry: Microservices register their network location, making it\n   possible to discover and interact with them dynamically. This is essential in\n   a dynamic environment where services frequently start and stop or migrate to\n   new hosts.\n\n * Service Discovery: The ability for a microservice to locate and invoke\n   another through its endpoint, typically facilitated by a service registry or\n   through an intermediary like a load balancer.\n\n * Bulkhead: The concept of isolating different parts of a system from each\n   other to prevent the failure of one from affecting the others.\n\n * Event Sourcing: Instead of persisting the current state of an entity, the\n   system persists a sequence of events that describe changes to that entity,\n   allowing users to reconstruct any state of the system.\n\n * Database per Service: Each microservice has a dedicated database, ensuring\n   autonomy and loose coupling.\n\n * Saga Pattern: Orchestrates multiple microservices to execute a series of\n   transactions in a way that maintains data consistency across the services.\n\n * Strangler Fig: A deployment pattern that gradually replaces \\( monolithic\\ or\n   \\( conventional\\) systems with a modern architecture, such as microservices.\n\n * Blue-Green Deployment: This strategy reduces downtime and risk by running two\n   identical production environments.

Failure Isolation: Preventing cascading failures ensures that malfunctioning\n    services do not drag down the entire application.\n 2. Latency Control: The pattern can quickly detect slow responses, preventing\n    unnecessary resource consumption and improving overall system performance.\n 3. Graceful Degradation: It promotes a better user experience by continuing to\n    operate, though possibly with reduced functionality, even when services are\n    partially or completely unavailable.\n 4. Fast Recovery: After the system or service recovers from a failure, the\n    circuit breaker transitions to its closed or half-open state, restoring\n    normal operations promptly.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION\n\nIn a microservices environment, the circuit breaker pattern is often employed\nwith libraries like Netflix's Hystrix or Resilience4J and languages like Java or\n.NET.\n\nHYSTRIX EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\nHystrixCommand<?> command = new HystrixCommand<>(HystrixCommand.Setter\n  .withGroupKey(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey(\"ExampleGroup\"))\n  .andCommandPropertiesDefaults(HystrixCommandProperties.Setter()\n     .withCircuitBreakerErrorThresholdPercentage(50)));\n\n\nRESILIENCE4J EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\nCircuitBreakerConfig config = CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()\n  .failureRateThreshold(20)\n  .ringBufferSizeInClosedState(5)\n  .build();\n\nCircuitBreaker circuitBreaker = CircuitBreakerRegistry.of(config).circuitBreaker(\"example\");\n\n\n.NET'S POLLY EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nvar circuitBreakerPolicy = Policy\n  .Handle<SomeExceptionType>()\n  .CircuitBreaker(3, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60));\n\n\nASYNCHRONOUS USE CASES\n\nFor asynchronous activities, such as making API calls in a microservices\ncontext, the strategy can adapt to handle these as well.

Synchronous Communication: Via REST or gRPC, which ensures immediate\n    consistency but can lead to performance issues and tight coupling.\n 2. Asynchronous Communication: Using message queues which ensure eventual\n    consistency but are more resilient and performant.\n 3. Eventual Consistency with Compensating Actions: Involves completing a series\n    of potentially inconsistent operations within a microservice and\n    compensating for any errors, often orchestrated through a dedicated event\n    handler.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Synchronous Communication with RESTful APIs\nimport requests\n\ndef place_order(order):\n    response = requests.post('http://order-service/api/v1/orders', json=order)\n    if response.status_code == 201:\n        return \"Order placed successfully\"\n    else:\n        return \"Order placement failed\"\n\n# Potential downside: If the order service is down, the basket service cannot commit the transaction.\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION WITH EVENT BUS\n\nHere is the RabbitMQ code:\n\nProducer:\n\nimport pika\n\ndef send_order(order):\n    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))\n    channel = connection.channel()\n    channel.queue_declare(queue='order_queue')\n    channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='order_queue', body=order)\n    connection.close()\n\n# No blocking operation or transactional context ensures high performance.\n\n\nConsumer:\n\n# Consumes the 'order_queue'\n# Processes the order asynchronously\n\n\n\nEVENTUAL CONSISTENCY WITH COMPENSATING ACTIONS\n\nCAP THEOREM\n\nThe CAP theorem states that it's impossible for a distributed data store to\nsimultaneously provide more than two of the following three guarantees:\nConsistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.\n\nBASE (BASICALLY AVAILABLE, SOFT STATE, EVENTUALLY CONSISTENT)\n\nBASE is an acronym that describes the properties of many NoSQL databases.

To isolate\nparts of the system for testing, mocks and stubs are invaluable. Stubs provide\ncanned responses, while mocks validate the behavior of the system under test.\n\nFrameworks like WireMock or mockito can assist in creating these.\n\nSMART END-TO-END TESTS WITH CUCUMBER\n\nEnd-to-end (e2e) tests are crucial to ensure the proper integration of service\ncomponents. However, these tests can be challenging to maintain as microservices\nevolve independently. Tools like Cucumber alleviate this issue through the use\nof easily comprehensible, plain-text specifications. They also help improve\ntesting coverage.\n\nCHAOS TESTING\n\nIn a microservices architecture, system components can fail independently. Chaos\ntesting, popularized by Netflix’s \"Chaos Monkey,\" injects various forms of\nfailure—such as latency or downtime—into the system to assess its resilience.\nTools like Gremlin automate this approach, empowering teams to identify and\nremediate vulnerabilities.\n\nCANARY AND BLUE/GREEN DEPLOYMENTS\n\nCanary and blue/green deployments ('all-at-once' or 'rolling') are deployment\nstrategies that you can use to handle updates to your microservices. These\nstrategies are designed to manage risk during deployment and can help you\nidentify issues early in the deployment process. You can use Chaos Engineering\ntechniques to add more stability and confidence in your deployments.\n\nMULTI-REGION DEPLOYMENTS\n\nUsing multi-region deployments, you can duplicate and distribute your services\nacross different geographical locations to mitigate the effects of a\nregion-specific outage. This offers a more robust, widely accessible, and\nreliable service.\n\nIMMUTABLE ARCHITECTURES\n\nAn immutable architecture involves replacing, rather than updating, elements of\nyour application. This approach to microservice management offers a reliable,\nconsistent, and efficient way to handle changes.\n\nORCHESTRATION WITH KUBERNETES\n\nKubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.\nIts self-healing capabilities are especially relevant in a microservices\nenvironment, ensuring that the system can recover from faults without human\nintervention.\n\nBLAMELESS POSTMORTEMS\n\nInstituting blameless postmortems fosters a culture of continuous improvement,\nwhere teams openly discuss mistakes or system failures. This approach to\ntackling outages and discrepancies ensures a transparent process, where the\nfocus is on root cause analysis and learning, not assigning blame.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CHAOS MONKEY\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\n  public class ChaosMonkey {\n      public void killRandomService() {\n          // Method to induce failure\n      }\n  }\n","index":15,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"17.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU PREVENT CONFIGURATION DRIFT IN A MICROSERVICES ENVIRONMENT?","answer":"Configuration drift refers to inconsistencies that can occur between your\nintended infrastructure state and its actual deployment.

However, the focus here is on strategies outside of immutable\ninfrastructure.\n\n\nHOW TO ACHIEVE CONFIGURATION CONSISTENCY?\n\n 1. Centralized Configuration: Opt for a centralized configuration management\n    system or service, like Hashicorp's Consul, that ensure that all application\n    instances access the latest and uniform configuration data.\n\n 2. Version Control: Leverage version control repositories (e.g., Git) to record\n    your configuration changes. Automated deployments and CD pipelines can then\n    ensure that the code from the repository aligns with your production\n    systems.\n\n 3. Automated Auditing and Adjustments: Regularly review and, if necessary,\n    adjust deployed configurations to match the central one. Automated auditing\n    tools like Netflix's Archaius can assist in this process.\n\n 4. Container Orchestration Platforms: Emphasis on containerized architectures\n    and orchestration platforms, like Kubernetes, ensures that applications are\n    deployed uniformly and consistently according to their container definition.\n    This mandates that the service definition is consistent across all nodes.\n\n 5. Dependency Management and Testing: Continuous Integration/Continuous\n    Deployment (CI/CD) isn't limited to application code. It should also include\n    dependencies like configuration data, with tests to verify compatibility and\n    consistency.\n\n 6. Service Registries: Implement service registries, such as Eureka, so\n    services can dynamically discover others. This minimizes the need for static\n    configuration files that could fall out of sync.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CI/CD PIPELINE\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom git import Repo\nimport os\n\n# Clone or pull the configuration repository\nconfig_repo_path = 'path/to/configuration/repo'\nif os.path.exists(config_repo_path):\n    repo = Repo(config_repo_path)\n    repo.remotes.origin.pull()\nelse:\n    repo = Repo.clone_from('https://github.com/organization/config-repo.git', config_repo_path)\n\n# Deploy configurations using the repository's latest version\n# This is a simplified example; in an actual deployment, you might use a config management tool\n# like Ansible or Terraform to handle the deployment process.\ndeploy_configurations(config_repo_path)\n","index":16,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"18.\n\n\nWHEN SHOULD YOU USE SYNCHRONOUS VS. ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION IN MICROSERVICES?","answer":"Deciding between synchronous and asynchronous communication in a microservices\narchitecture requires carefully considering various factors, such as service\nboundaries, data dependencies, fault tolerance, performance, and consistency.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSERVICE BOUNDARIES\n\n * Recommendation: Start with synchronous communication for intra-service tasks\n   and choose asynchronous communication for inter-service tasks requiring loose\n   coupling.\n\n * Data Dependencies:\n   \n   * Recommendation: Synchronous communication can be more practical when you\n     have data dependencies that demand both request and response. Asynchronous\n     communication provides greater decoupling but might require additional\n     strategies, like eventual consistency, to ensure data integrity.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND LATENCY REQUIREMENTS\n\n * Recommendation: If low latency and immediate response are necessary, opt for\n   synchronous communication. However, for tasks where immediate responses\n   aren't critical, like notifications or batch processing, asynchronous\n   communication is more suitable.\n\nFAULT TOLERANCE AND RESILIENCE\n\n * Recommendation: Asynchronous communication, especially with message queues\n   that support retry and error handling, offers better resilience against\n   failures. Synchronous communication can lead to cascading failures. Thus,\n   decoupling with asynchronous communication enhances the overall robustness of\n   the system.\n\nCOMPLEXITY AND OPERATIONAL OVERHEAD\n\n * Recommendation: Simplicity favors synchronous communication, making it easier\n   to understand for developers, troubleshoot, and monitor. On the other hand,\n   the additional complexity of managing asynchronous communication might be\n   justified when it offers clear architectural advantages, such as better\n   decoupling.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SYNCHRONOUS VS ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Synchronous Service\nclass UserRegistrationService:\n    def register_user(self, user_data):\n        user_validation_service = UserValidationService()\n        if user_validation_service.validate(user_data):\n            user_db_service = UserDBService()\n            return user_db_service.save(user_data)\n        return None\n\n# Asynchronous Service\nclass EmailNotificationService:\n    def send_welcome_email(self, email):\n        message_queue = MessageQueue()\n        message_queue.push(\"welcome_email\", email)\n    ```\n\nIn this code, the `UserRegistrationService` performs registration synchronously, validating the user and then persisting the data. It uses a modular approach without direct coupling. However, `EmailNotificationService` uses an **asynchronous approach**. It doesn't send the welcome email immediately after registration but enqueues the task to send later. This way, the registration process isn't delayed or affected if the email service experiences any brief downtimes.","index":17,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"19.\n\n\nWHAT ROLE DOES CONTAINERIZATION PLAY IN MICROSERVICES?","answer":"Containerization is pivotal for building, deploying, and running microservices\ndue to the consistent, isolated environments it provides.

Here are the strategies\nto overcome these challenges:\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR DATABASE SCHEMA EVOLUTION\n\nAUTO-GENERATION OF SCHEMA\n\nSome frameworks, such as Hibernate in Java, can auto-create or update database\nschemas based on defined models. Although this aids agility and reduces manual\nefforts, it can be risky and is generally not recommended for production\nenvironments.\n\nDATABASE MIGRATIONS\n\nTools like Flyway and Liquibase enable version-controlled management of database\nschema changes. Each microservice defines its changes in migration scripts,\nensuring consistency and accountability.\n\nSCHEMA REGISTRY\n\nA centralized system that tracks every schema change across microservices can\nprovide a global version and historical context. A tool like Confluent Schema\nRegistry is tailored for use with Apache Kafka.\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR SERVICE COORDINATION\n\nSYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION\n\nDirect dependencies between services, e.g., via RESTful APIs, can be used to\norchestrate synchronous schema migrations when active coordination is necessary.\n\nASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION\n\nFor loose coupling and independent operations, message queues or\npublish-subscribe systems are employed. These mechanisms permit services to\nreact asynchronously to changes, as and when they occur.\n\n\nDECOUPLING DATABASE SCHEMAS\n\nEACH SERVICE HAS ITS DATABASE\n\nTo ensure high cohesion and strong boundaries, each microservice owns its data\nand has its independent database. This approach aligns well with the single\nresponsibility principle.\n\nSHARED SCHEMAS\n\nIn specific scenarios where shared data models are required, a clean and\nexplicit contract for the schema can be established. This is often regulated\nthrough a separate microservice treated as the 'source of truth'.\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR DATA CONSISTENCY\n\nSYNCHRONOUS VALIDATION\n\nImmediate data validation via direct calls or a centralized service guarantees\nconsistency. This approach is standard during initial data ingest and updates.\n\nEVENTUAL CONSISTENCY\n\nWhen real-time consistency isn't mandatory, changes can be propagated via\nasynchronous messages, potentially leading to a transiently inconsistent state.\nThis strategy is valuable in systems where high availability and partition\ntolerance are priorities.\n\nKEEPING DATA IMMUTABLE\n\nWhere applicable, especially in audit trails or financial transactions, updates\ncan be avoided, and instead, a new state can be appended as an event.

Here are some\ntechniques to maintain data consistency without relying on distributed\ntransactions:\n\n\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Prefer Eventual Consistency: Fine-tune microservices and the system as a\n   whole to support eventual consistency where making 'best effort' for\n   consistency suffices.\n\n * Understand the Cost of Consistency: Strive for a balance between consistency,\n   availability, and partition tolerance (based on the CAP theorem). Stronger\n   consistency often comes at the cost of reduced availability.\n\n * Isolate Critical Operations: Identify and isolate operations that are highly\n   sensitive to consistency requirements. Non-transactional techniques are often\n   sufficient for less critical tasks.\n\n\nTECHNIQUES FOR MAINTAINING DATA CONSISTENCY\n\nCODE-LEVEL TECHNIQUES\n\n * Use Idempotency: Ensure that multiple, identical operations have the same\n   result as a single one. This way, duplications don't lead to adverse effects.\n\n * Optimistic Concurrency Control: Manage concurrent access to data, for\n   example, by using versioning or timestamps. If a conflict is detected, the\n   service can return an error and let the calling service handle the\n   inconsistency.\n\n * Compensating Actions: When an operation fails or results in inconsistency,\n   introduce compensating actions to correct the inconsistency after the fact.\n\nCOMMUNICATION PATTERNS\n\n * Policies for Failure and Timeout: Use robust communication patterns with\n   built-in error handling and timeouts. For instance, in potentially unsafe\n   networks with eventual consistency requirements, messages can be retried or\n   moved to a dead-letter queue.\n\n * Asynchronous Collaboration: Leverage message brokers for asynchronous\n   communication between services. This allows for loose coupling and helps\n   handle temporary service unavailability.\n\nSTATE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES\n\n * Event Sourcing: Persist all domain events that have occurred in the system.\n   Services use these events to reconstruct or update their data.

Here are strategies to\nensure robust performance during such periods:\n\n\nHORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SCALING\n\nHorizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, entails adding more instances of\na service. Vertical scaling, or scaling up, involves increasing resources (CPU,\nmemory, etc.) on existing instances.\n\nWHEN TO USE EACH METHOD\n\n * Horizontal Scaling: Suitable for stateless services. Commonly used in\n   microservices where multiple stateless instances can process the same\n   transaction without relying on the state of other instances.\n * Vertical Scaling: Better for stateful services, where the existing state of\n   an instance significantly impacts its performance. Also beneficial when a\n   single instance can handle burst traffic.\n\n\nLOAD BALANCING\n\nLoad balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets (microservice\ninstances) to ensure no single instance is overwhelmed.\n\nLOAD BALANCING METHODS\n\n * Round Robin: Requests are equally distributed.\n * Least Connections: New requests are routed to the microservice instance with\n   the fewest active connections.\n * IP Hashing: Maps a client's IP address to a specific target, ensuring\n   subsequent requests from the same client go to the same instance.\n\n\nCACHING\n\n * In-Memory Caching: Reduces reliance on backend services, thereby speeding up\n   responses.\n * Distributed Caching: Keeps frequently accessed data available across multiple\n   nodes, promoting consistent access and reduced latency.\n\n\nASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION AND EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE\n\nBy decoupling services and using message queues or publish/subscribe mechanisms,\nmicroservices can handle bursts of traffic without requiring immediate,\nsynchronous responses for every request.\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\n * Pros: Better resilience and responsiveness under load. Enables event-driven\n   design.\n * Cons: Increased complexity due to components such as message brokers.\n\n\nQUEUEING AND BACKGROUND JOBS\n\nFor tasks that don't require immediate processing or aren't suitable for\nsynchronous handling, microservices can use queues or background job processors.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Decouples processing from the synchronous request, improving response time.\n * Accommodates tasks requiring more extensive computation or data processing.\n * Primes microservices for recovery or rerun in case of failures.\n\n\nRATE LIMITING AND THROTTLING\n\nBy enforcing limits on the number of incoming requests a microservice can handle\nwithin a specific time frame, the system can ensure fairness and distribute load\neffectively.\n\nTWO COMMON APPROACHES\n\n * Token Bucket Algorithm: Clients receive tokens at a fixed rate. Each token\n   allows them to process a request. Unused tokens are not accumulated.\n * Leaky Bucket Algorithm: Requests are processed at a constant rate. If the\n   bucket overflows, requests are delayed or dropped.\n\n\nCIRCUIT-BREAKER PATTERN\n\nThis pattern can help prevent a microservice from becoming unresponsive due to\ncascading failures from other services. When a service reaches a configured\nfailure threshold, the circuit breaks, and further requests are not sent for a\nspecified duration. This period allows the service to recover.\n\n\nHYBRID STRATEGIES AND AUTO-SCALING\n\nAdvanced cloud providers offer auto-scaling, adjusting the number of running\ninstances based on real-time traffic.

They primarily rely on client-side, also known as \"DNS-based\" or\n\"Proxy-based\", and less commonly on \"Server-Side Load Balancing\" to optimize\ndata flow.\n\n\nLOAD BALANCING STRATEGIES\n\n * Server-Side Load Balancing: Manages traffic through a centrally located\n   balancer, which then distributes requests. This pattern often underpins\n   client-side and Proxy-based approaches.\n   \n   Example: Microservices can use Kubernetes Service for server-side load\n   balancing.\n\n * Client-Side Load Balancing: Here, individual clients are responsible for\n   distributing requests equally among multiple microservice instances.\n   Techniques such as Round-Robin and Weighted Round Robin allocate requests.\n   \n   Example: In Kubernetes, the kube-dns system enables client-side load\n   balancing.\n\n * Proxy-Based Load Balancing: This integrated approach sees microservices\n   front-ended by a dedicated proxy, which consolidates incoming requests and\n   dispatches them to available service instances.\n   \n   Example: Microservices can use a sidecar proxy like Envoy or linkerd for\n   unified, optimized communication between microservices.\n\n\nIN-ACTION LOAD-BALANCING TECHNIQUES\n\nROUND-ROBIN\n\n * Description: This straightforward method sends subsequent requests to each\n   microservice instance one by one, effectively rotating across the available\n   servers. While simple, it might not be the most efficient in determining the\n   most suitable service instance for every request.\n\n * Use-Cases: Particularly effective in processing stateless, idempotent\n   functions and where a basic, uniform distribution of requests is sufficient.\n\n * Example: While performing a health check or a less data-sensitive operation,\n   such as a simple, read-only data retrieval.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ROUND ROBIN LOAD-BALANCING ALGORITHM\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nclass RoundRobinBalancer:\n    def __init__(self, servers):\n        self.servers = servers\n        self.last_used = -1\n    \n    def get_next_server(self):\n        self.last_used = (self.last_used + 1) % len(self.servers)\n        return self.servers[self.last_used]\n\n# Example usage\nserver_list = [\"server1\", \"server2\", \"server3\"]\nrr_balancer = RoundRobinBalancer(server_list)\nfor _ in range(5):\n    print(rr_balancer.get_next_server())\n\n\nWEIGHTED ROUND ROBIN\n\n * Description: To cater to each instance's varying capacities or priorities,\n   this technique accords or \"weights\" each server differently. Servers with\n   higher weights handle proportionately more requests.\n\n * Use-Cases: Ideal when microservice instances have distinct capabilities or\n   resource pools, enabling a tailored distribution of requests.\n\n * Example: When two servers, one with higher computing power than the other,\n   might be deployed. The weighted round-robin algorithm ensures that the more\n   powerful server receives a greater share of requests.\n\n\nBEST LOAD-BALANCING STRATEGIES FOR MICROSERVICES\n\n * Do-It-All Service Locator: Microservices might utilize this pattern to keep\n   track of all available service instances and their associated attributes. The\n   pattern's effectiveness hinges on how seamlessly it manages service discovery\n   and keeps the list of all microservice instances up-to-date.\n   \n   Example: In Kubernetes, services rely on a built-in DNS for service\n   discovery. Metrics gathering with Prometheus can further ensure that the list\n   of endpoints is current.\n\n * Session Persistence: Sometimes called \"Sticky Sessions\", this strategy steers\n   multiple requests from a particular user session or client to the same\n   microservice instance. While it ensures consistency for sessions or clients,\n   it might create imbalance in the overall traffic distribution.\n   \n   Example: An e-commerce application might use this technique to ensure that a\n   shopper's cart remains with the same microservice instance throughout their\n   visit, maintaining session state.\n\n * Geo-Distribution: Especially relevant when microservice architecture brings\n   global reach, this strategy sees requests directed based on their source or\n   destination, taking potential geographic advantages into account.\n   \n   Example: In a fault-tolerant network, requests from users on the West Coast\n   of the United States can be directed to the nearest data center, thereby\n   potentially optimizing latency. Furthermore, real-estate websites, for\n   instance, can compile listings that are local to the user's geographical\n   area.\n\n * Traffic Steering with Real-Time Metrics: Here, loads are managed based on\n   live, up-to-the-minute statistics. Such an approach can dynamically react to\n   spikes in traffic, ensuring a reliable and optimized response under varying\n   traffic patterns.\n   \n   Example: Google Cloud's Traffic Director leverages real-time metrics to\n   regulate load distribution, reacting to changes in backend service health and\n   network conditions.\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR EFFICIENT LOAD BALANCING\n\n * Fault Tolerance: An optimal load-balancing strategy continues to function,\n   allocating traffic even if a service instance becomes unhealthy. This ensures\n   that the system as a whole doesn't decrease in operational capability due to\n   a single unhealthy instance.\n\n * Latency Minimization: Certain clients might have stringent latency\n   requirements. The most effective load-balancer would be one that guarantees\n   that client requests can be rapidly satisfied by choosing the best-performing\n   service instance.\n\n * Overhead: The additional computational resources required by the load\n   balancer entity to choose the most suitable service instance for the client's\n   request should be minimal.\n\n * Consistency: In some circumstances, clients might need to maintain consistent\n   connections with the same backend service instance, necessitating changes in\n   request routing to be rare.","index":38,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"40.\n\n\nIN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, WHAT WOULD INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION TO USE A MESSAGE\nBROKER VS DIRECT SERVICE-TO-SERVICE COMMUNICATION?","answer":"When architecting microservice systems, selecting communication patterns between\nservices - such as message brokering systems or direct network communication -\nis critical for achieving the desired performance.

Added Time for Inter-Service Communication: Invoking microservices over the\n    network often takes more time compared to in-process calls.\n\n 2. Distributed Data Access Latency: Data access in a microservices environment\n    can be slower due to the need to retrieve data from multiple services or\n    remote databases.\n\n 3. Potential Bottlenecks: Delays can propagate, impacting dependent services.\n    This is known as the \"waterfall effect\" or \"cascading failure.\"\n\n\nMITIGATION STRATEGIES\n\n 1. Latency-Aware Service Selection: Employ service-discovery and invocation\n    libraries that consider service health and latency. Various load-balancing\n    algorithms such as \"Least Pending Requests\" or \"Adaptive\" can help in this\n    context.\n\n 2. Data Locality: Look for patterns where services repeatedly access the same\n    shared data. In these cases, deploying related services on the same server\n    or using in-memory data stores (e.g., Redis) can optimize access speed.\n\n 3. Caching: Introduce caching mechanisms like client-side caching, where\n    services cache data they often consume. This can reduce the need for calls\n    to remote services or databases.\n\n 4. Asynchronous Communication: Where the immediate consistency of data is not\n    crucial, adopt asynchronous messaging systems such as Kafka or RabbitMQ.\n    This offloads non-critical tasks to be processed later, reducing the overall\n    response time.\n\n 5. Timeouts and Retries: Implement sensible timeouts (e.g., 1-5 seconds) for\n    inter-service calls. Beyond that, invoke retries with exponential backoff,\n    increasing intervals to minimize stalling or load on services experiencing\n    transient issues.\n\n 6. Cache Freshness: If using caching, ensure that the cached data is\n    up-to-date. You can employ techniques such as cache invalidation or setting\n    a time-to-live (TTL) for cached data.\n\n 7. Adaptive Load Management: Use circuit breakers to mitigate latency effects.\n    They trip if a service is consistently slow or unresponsive, temporarily\n    redirecting traffic to different services. They also self-heal, gradually\n    allowing traffic once the service is operational.","index":42,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"44.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MESSAGE QUEUES AND EVENT BUSES.

Event Recording: As part of a database transaction, the microservice records\n    the event in the same transactional context that updates its state.\n\n 2. Outbox: The recorded event is placed in an outbox table within the database.\n    The outbox acts as a reliable and transactional message buffer.\n\n 3. Polling and Distribution: An external process, often a separate microservice\n    or an isolated thread, polls the outbox table at regular intervals. Once\n    events are retrieved, they are packaged and sent to the respective\n    microservices, typically via a message broker.\n\n 4. Message Publishing: The external process sends the events to the message\n    broker, ensuring reliable delivery to consumer microservices.\n\n 5. Consumer Processing: Once delivered through the message broker, consumer\n    microservices, such as the ordering or inventory systems, process the events\n    to reflect changes in their own context.\n\n 6. Transactional Integrity: If any part of the process, from recording the\n    event to message publishing, fails, the database transaction associated with\n    the original action is rolled back, ensuring atomicity.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TRANSACTIONAL OUTBOX\n\nHere is the Kotlin code:\n\n// Event definition (Kotlin data class)\ndata class OrderPlacedEvent(val orderId: String, val totalAmount: Double)\n\n// Order service\n@Transactional\nfun placeOrder(order: Order) {\n    val savedOrder = orderRepository.save(order)\n  \n    // Record OrderPlacedEvent in the outbox table\n    val event = OrderPlacedEvent(savedOrder.id, savedOrder.totalAmount)\n    outboxRepository.save(OutboxRecord(event))\n}\n\n...\n\n// Outbox polling service\n@Component\nclass OutboxPoller(\n    private val outboxRepository: OutboxRepository,\n    private val messagePublisher: MessagePublisher\n) {\n\n  @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000)\n  fun pollOutbox() {\n      val pendingEvents = outboxRepository.findPendingEvents()\n      pendingEvents.forEach {\n          messagePublisher.publish(it.event)\n          it.markAsPublished() // This method will mark the event as published in the database\n      }\n  }\n}\n\n// Message publisher\n@Component\nclass MessagePublisher(private val messageBroker: MessageBroker) {\n  fun publish(event: Any) {\n      messageBroker.publish(event)\n  }\n}\n\n// OrderPlacedEvent handler in the inventory service\n@Component\nclass OrderPlacedEventHandler(private val inventoryService: InventoryService) {\n  fun handle(event: OrderPlacedEvent) {\n      inventoryService.reserveStock(event.orderId, event.totalAmount)\n  }\n}\n","index":44,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"46.\n\n\nHOW WOULD YOU DESIGN A MICROSERVICE TO BE FAULT-TOLERANT?","answer":"Fault tolerance is a critical aspect of microservice architecture ensuring high\nsystem availability and reliability.\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR FAULT TOLERANCE\n\n * Graceful Degradation: A service adapts to lower performance levels during\n   failures.\n * Fail-Safe Defaults: If a service can't fulfill a request, it provides a\n   default response to avoid system slow-down.\n * Circuit Breaker: Monitors for failures and stops sending requests to a faulty\n   service for a predefined duration.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Hosting Environment: The platform where the service runs, such as Kubernetes,\n   provides fault tolerance mechanisms like self-healing.\n * Communication: The way services interact, typically through protocols such as\n   HTTP or messaging middleware.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CIRCUIT BREAKER WITH RESILIENCE4J\n\nHere is the Java code:\n\nCircuitBreakerConfig config = CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()\n  .failureRateThreshold(20)\n  .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofSeconds(30))\n  .slidingWindowSize(5)\n  .build();\n\nCircuitBreaker breaker = CircuitBreaker.of(\"myBreaker\", config);\n\nSupplier<String> backendService = () -> {\n  // Code to call the actual service\n  return \"Result\";\n};\n\nString result = breaker.executeSupplier(backendService, t -> \"Fallback\");\n","index":45,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"47.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMEOUTS AND RETRY LOGIC IN A MICROSERVICES\nARCHITECTURE.","answer":"In a microservices architecture, dealing with distributed operations requires\ncareful planning due to the potential for latency, network issues, and service\nunavailability.

Passive Redundancy: Involves having standby components ready to take over in\n    case of failure. This is typically seen in systems using load balancers,\n    where the load balancer detects unhealthy instances and directs traffic to\n    healthy ones.\n\n 2. Active Redundancy: Uses multiple live components, where each operates\n    independently. This allows for load shedding as the components can\n    distribute the incoming traffic by utilizing the shared load balancer.\n    However, this may lead to the inefficiency of managing a large number of\n    unused or idle components and hence impact cost.\n\n 3. Data Replication: Commonly used with databases, this involves storing data\n    in multiple locations to ensure redundancy. The most basic implementation\n    might employ a \"primary\" and \"replica\" setup.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS COORDINATION\n\nDistributed systems are a cornerstone of microservices. Here are some tools and\nmethods to aid in their coordinated operation:\n\n 1. Shared Data: Systems can share data via a centralized database or by\n    utilizing distributed data stores or caches, such as Apache Ignite or\n    Consul.\n\n 2. Common Schema and Versioning: Enforce a consistent schema across services to\n    ensure data compatibility. Also, have versioning in place so that older\n    systems are not disrupted when newer features are rolled out.\n\n 3. Asynchronous Communication: Decouple services by using communication\n    patterns like message queues or event-based systems. This allows the sender\n    to keep functioning, even if there are no immediate recipients or the\n    recipients are down.\n\n 4. Service Discovery: Services need to be able to find each other in a dynamic\n    and potentially elastically scaled ecosystem. Tools like ZooKeeper or etcd\n    can handle this task.\n\n 5. Distributed Tracing and Logging: Tools like Jaeger or Zipkin help in\n    understanding performance of systems and identifying issues in a distributed\n    architecture.\n\n 6. Statelessness and Idempotence: The principle of idempotence ensures that the\n    same action, when done repeatedly, will yield the same result--even in the\n    face of failures or partial success. Similarly, services should aim to be\n    stateless, ideally reducing their reliance on shared external resources.\n\n 7. Automated Deployments, Replicas, and Routers: Automating deployment\n    processes using containers and orchestration tools like Kubernetes\n    drastically reduce the load on developers and ops teams, and make systems\n    more resilient.\n\n 8.

Let's look at how they operate and their core components.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTED TRACING\n\nDistributed Tracing, a method of monitoring and diagnosing distributed\nmicroservice architectures, involves three key components:\n\n 1. Tracer: A library or agent installed with each microservice. It generates\n    and sends trace data to a central server asynchronously.\n\n 2. Collector: The central server that ingests, stores, and indexes trace data.\n    The collector acts as a single point of contact between microservices.\n\n 3. Visualizer/Backend: It provides a way to visualize trace data, most commonly\n    through tools like Zipkin, Jaeger, or Datadog.\n\n\nCORE CONCEPTS\n\n * Trace: Represents a complete user request, comprising multiple spans.\n * Span: Indicates a distinct operation or event within the trace, such as an\n   HTTP call or database query.\n\nDistributed Tracing\n[https://tech.schoolwithflair.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Distributed-Tracing-Architecture.jpg]\n\n\nTRACER, SPAN, AND CONTEXT PROPAGATION\n\nTracers record and propagate spans across service boundaries. Each span\ntypically contains metadata, a unique identifier, and timing information.\n\nTracer Propagation mechanisms, such as correlation IDs, are used for context\npropagation.\n\nThe most prominent transport for this propagation is HTTP, utilizing various\nschemes such as:\n\n * B3\n * W3C Trace Context\n * AWS X-Ray\n * Google's Cloud Trace\n\nLessons Learned from Industry Leaders\n\n * Netflix's Sleuth employs ThreadLocal to store context, minimizing the need\n   for explicit context passing.\n\n * Zipkin's approach involves assigning a unique trace ID and sampling flag to\n   each request's headers.\n\n * Google's Cloud Trace benefits from integrating this mechanism with Google\n   Cloud's infrastructure for seamless, automatic propagation.","index":51,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"53.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF METRICS AND ALERTS IN MAINTAINING A MICROSERVICES\nARCHITECTURE.","answer":"Building a robust microservices architecture requires a comprehensive\nunderstanding of how to effectively measure, monitor, and set up alerts for the\nvarious microservices.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE OF METRICS\n\nMetrics serve as the yardstick for microservices performance, supporting\ndecision-making and enhancing reliability.\n\nKEY METRICS\n\n * Availability: Measured by the percentage of time a service is operational.\n * Latency: How quickly a service processes a request.\n * Error Rate: The percentage of failed requests.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Quick Troubleshooting: Instant visibility into potential issues helps teams\n   identify and correct problems promptly.\n * Proactive Maintenance: Regular monitoring and metric tracking can often\n   predict potential issues, enabling pre-emptive action.\n * Data-Driven Scaling: Accurate metrics provide insights into resource needs,\n   supporting informed scaling decisions.\n * SLA Adherence: Ensures that services are meeting defined service-level\n   agreements.\n\n\nESTABLISHING ALERTS\n\nAlerts are vital for detecting and respond to service issues in real-time.\nAutomated tools inform teams when certain thresholds are breached.\n\nCRITERIA FOR ALERTS\n\n * Thresholds: Set points where metrics indicate a problem, such as high latency\n   or downtime.\n * Frequency: The regularity with which a metric should be measured.\n * Sensitivity: The level of deviation from normal behavior that triggers an\n   alert.\n\nPRACTICAL USE-CASES\n\n 1. SLA Violations: Alerts go off when a service fails to meet its expected\n    availability or latency targets.\n 2. Error Surges: Alerts prompt action when a service begins delivering an\n    abnormally high rate of errors.\n 3.

Creation: Containers are usually created through an orchestration system\n    such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. The configuration necessary for the\n    container's operation, such as environment variables, network setup, and\n    mounting volumes, is provided at this stage.\n\n 2. Initialization: Task-oriented containers must perform any needed\n    pre-processing before taking on tasks. For example, a database container\n    might initialize by setting up the database schema, while an application\n    container could cache data or run migrations.\n\n 3. Live Operation: The container is fully operational and completes the tasks\n    specific to its service. It becomes available for general operation, such as\n    serving network requests or processing background jobs.\n\n 4. Shutting Down: After the tasks are completed, the container typically\n    undergoes a graceful shutdown to ensure that any unsaved data is persisted.\n    This stage, also managed by the orchestration system, allows the container\n    time to wrap up any remaining tasks before being destroyed.\n\n 5. Deletion: Once the shutdown is verified, the orchestration system removes\n    container instances, either because they are no longer needed or as a part\n    of auto-scaling actions.\n\n\nMANAGING THE LIFECYCLE\n\n * Manual: Less common in a microservices environment, this approach entails\n   direct intervention by developers or administrators.\n * Automatic: Utilizing an orchestration system, lifecycle management becomes\n   automatic and ensures tasks are completed efficiently and consistently.\n\n\nENSURING COMPLIANCE\n\nAdhering to the separation of concerns and best practices like persistence,\nmonitoring, and loose coupling is essential at every stage.\n\n 1. Environment Isolation: Ensure that container environments, especially for\n    multiple services, are insulated from one another to prevent unintended\n    consequences.\n\n 2. Consistent Configuration: Each container should receive a configuration\n    tailored to its needs. Dynamic management systems can help keep\n    configurations current.\n\n 3. Data Integrity: Containers engaging with stateful data sources such as\n    databases or external files should handle data accordingly to ensure\n    consistency and security.\n\n 4. Dynamic Setup: As needs evolve, containers may need reconfiguration instead\n    of recreation. Dynamic setups ensure that running containers adapt to those\n    changes.\n\n 5. Graceful Termination: A container should be designed to close ongoing tasks\n    or connections without abrupt disruptions. Services such as load balancers\n    help direct traffic away from a container scheduled for shutdown.\n\n 6. Resource Management: Monitoring and managing container resources can prevent\n    issues such as memory leaks or resource exhaustion. Orchestration platforms\n    can dynamically adjust container resources to maintain equilibrium.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONTAINER LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT IN KUBERNETES\n\nHere is the YAML file:\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: lifecycle-demo\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: lifecycle-demo\n    image: nginx\n    lifecycle:\n      postStart:\n        exec:\n          command: [\"echo\", \"Container started\"]\n      preStop:\n        exec:\n          command: [\"echo\", \"Container about to terminate\"]\n\n\nIn this Kubernetes example, the container will print to standard output when it\nstarts and just before it stops.","index":57,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"59.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT CONTAINERS ARE SECURE AND UP-TO-DATE?","answer":"Ensuring container security is essential in microservice architectures.\nEstablish thorough practices to maintain stacks and containers.\n\n\nCONTAINER SECURITY BEST PRACTICES\n\n 1.  Image Security:\n     \n     * Use a Package Manager: Regularly update, test, and patch container images\n       for underlying software vulnerabilities.\n     * Image Scanning: Employ tools like Clair, Anchore, or proprietary\n       solutions to detect and report security issues.\n\n 2.  Run-time Security:\n     \n     * Define Attack Surface: Utilize tools like Docker Bench for Security to\n       identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.\n     * Implement Access Control: Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) using\n       Kubernetes, Docker Enterprise, or other solutions.\n\n 3.  Network Security:\n     \n     * Use Firewalls: Block unnecessary inbound and outbound traffic.\n     * Employ Network Policies: Use Kubernetes to control in-pod and inter-pod\n       traffic and ensure only authorized, defined traffic flows.\n\n 4.  Logging and Monitoring:\n     \n     * Implement Centralized Logging: Utilize solutions like ELK (Elasticsearch,\n       Logstash, Kibana) stack or Fluentd for aggregated log management.\n     * Set up Alerts: Employ tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or built-in\n       solutions in cloud offerings to create alerts and take actions upon\n       specific conditions.\n\n 5.  Management and Governance:\n     \n     * Lifecycle Management: Set up automated processes for image updates to\n       prevent using outdated and potentially unsafe images.\n     * Compliance Checks: Utilize tools to assure compliance with relevant\n       standards. For instance, OpenSCAP can be used with Red Hat container\n       images to ensure security compliance with industry standards.\n\n 6.  Secret Management:\n     \n     * Utilize Secrets Management Tools: Securely store and manage sensitive\n       data throughout an application's lifecycle using tools like Kubernetes\n       Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager.\n\n 7.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC):\n     \n     * Employing IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation enables teams to\n       define and control the container environment and related resources as\n       code.\n\n 8.  Disaster Recovery and Backup:\n     \n     * Implement backup strategies for containers. Cloud providers often offer\n       services for automated snapshots of managed container clusters.\n\n 9.  Continuous Monitoring:\n     \n     * Regularly monitor container health, resource usage, and potential\n       security risks.\n\n 10. Authentication and Authorization:\n     \n     * Implement robust identity management practices in Kubernetes or other\n       container orchestration systems.\n     * Leverage technologies like OIDC (OpenID Connect) for identity\n       verification.\n\n 11. Health Checks:\n     \n     * Ensure containers are running as expected through periodical health\n       checks.\n     * Set up automated workflows to recreate or replace failed containers.\n\n 12. Secure and Versioned Configuration:\n     \n     * Use configuration management tools like ConfigMap or external solutions\n       like HashiCorp Consul to externalize configurations and keep them secure\n       and versioned.\n\n 13. Secure Development Practices:\n     \n     * Encourage developers to practice secure coding.\n     * Employ tools like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic\n       Application Security Testing (DAST) for containerized applications.\n\n 14. For Kafka specifically:\n     \n     * VPC and Security Groups: Leverage AWS VPC, security groups, IAM policies\n       and user controls to secure the Kafka cluster.\n     * Encryption and Authentication: Utilize encryption, TLS, and\n       authentication mechanisms like SAS, SCRAM, or Kerberos for secure\n       communication between producers, consumers, and brokers.","index":58,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"},{"text":"60.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES FOR CONTAINER NETWORKING IN THE CONTEXT OF\nMICROSERVICES?","answer":"Effective networking in a microservices architecture combines multiple\nprinciples for secure, scalable, and manageable communication.\n\n\nKEY PRACTICES OF CONTAINER NETWORKING\n\n 1. Isolation: Each microservice should have its own network stack. This\n    promotes security, better resource utilization, and minimizes layer 2\n    broadcast traffic.\n\n 2. Flat Layer 3 Networks: Deploy microservices in a single layer 3 flat network\n    segment, as opposed to traditional layer 2 domains segmented by virtual LANs\n    (VLANs). This method simplifies network configurations and minimizes\n    cross-data-center traffic.\n\n 3. Service Discovery: Use dynamic service discovery mechanisms that enable\n    services to locate and communicate with each other. Technologies like\n    Kubernetes' Service or HashiCorp's Consul API provide automatic load\n    balancing and expose services via well-defined endpoints.\n\n 4. Decentralized Control: Avoiding a single point of control (single point of\n    failure) for the network ensures fault tolerance and autonomy for individual\n    services.\n\n 5. IP Per Container: Ensure every container, or at least every microservice\n    instance, has a unique IP address. This practice enables direct\n    container-to-container communication and bypasses potential limitations of\n    external load balancers.\n\n 6. Security Policies: Enforce network security policies at the container level\n    using tools and frameworks like Container Network Policies in Kubernetes.\n\n 7. Quality of Service: Containers, in general, should get equal access to the\n    underlying infrastructure, which can be managed partly through container\n    networking.\n\n 8. Monitoring: Network activities should be logged and monitored, both for\n    security and performance reasons.\n\n\nNETWORKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTAINERS\n\n * Multi-Host vs. Single-Host Networking: Multi-host networking is generally a\n   more sophisticated and demanding setup, often requiring SDN technologies.\n\n * Overlay Networks: For simplifying network segment management, overlay\n   networks often stand out.\n\n * NAT Gateways: While they have benefits for some use cases, their use in\n   container networking isn't always recommended due to potential performance\n   impacts and added complexity.\n\n * Virtual IP Addresses: DHCP for containers can introduce additional complexity\n   and latency. However, static virtual IP addresses can simplify service\n   discovery.\n\n * HTTP-Based Communication Models: Use stateless connections or implement state\n   management at the application level without relying on the underlying network\n   connection state. This is a good practice for resilient and scalable\n   microservice design.\n\n * Ingress Controller: Hosted on the cluster, the Ingress Controller manages\n   incoming network traffic, enabling more granular control over routing.\n\n\nDISSECTING KEY CONCEPTS\n\nFLAT VS. SEGMENTED NETWORKS\n\n * Flat Networks: In the context of microservices, flat networking means using a\n   single IP address range across the entire fleet of services and their\n   instances. All containers, regardless of their host, are reachable in this\n   network.\n\n * Segmented Networks: Segmentation divides the network into distinct, isolated\n   pieces. While this offers tight control, it can complicate service discovery\n   and can generate higher latency across segments.\n\nINTRA-CLUSTER NETWORKING\n\n * Pod-to-Pod: Pods are the fundamental execution units in Kubernetes, hosting\n   one or more containers. They are deployed on the same node. Your task is to\n   create a K8s cluster and construct the inner workings with the best container\n   networking designs.\n\nINTER-CLUSTER NETWORKING\n\n * Service-to-Service Communication Across Data Centers: In a dispersed setup\n   across multiple data centers, microservices should still be reachable without\n   unduly high latencies. This is a problem in network design for microservices\n   that needs careful attention.\n\nCOMPONENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES\n\n * CIDR Block: Classless Inter-Domain Routing divides an IP address into two\n   regions: the network identifier and the host identifier.\n\n * Virtual Switches: These software components direct traffic between virtual\n   machines on the same host.\n\n * Kernel Networking Stack: The kernel networking stack implements the core\n   functionalities at the heart of network communications. Each network-enabled\n   computer has its own.","index":59,"topic":" Microservices ","category":"Machine Learning & Data Science Machine Learning"}]
