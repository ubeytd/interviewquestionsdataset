Move Pointers: The key step is to iteratively move the pointers based on\n    certain conditions typically until they either meet or cross each other.\n 3. Track the Problem State: As the pointers move through the array, you keep\n    track of certain conditions or values.\n\n\nTYPICAL CONFIGURATIONS\n\n * Single direction: Usually in array or list problems where both pointers move\n   in the same direction. Example: removing duplicates in sorted arrays.\n * Opposite direction: Used when both pointers progress towards each other.\n   Ideal for questions involving arrays and strings, when you're looking for\n   palindromes or similar structures.\n   Example: Finding substrings or sequences that satisfy a certain condition.\n * Best Sum: A technique where one pointer moves in one direction, and the other\n   in the reverse, such that, based on a certain condition, you can zero in on\n   the target.\n   Example: Finding a pair in a sorted array with a sum closest to k.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REMOVING DUPLICATES\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    tail = 0  # Pointer to store valid elements\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] != nums[tail]:\n            tail += 1\n            nums[tail] = nums[i]\n    return tail + 1  # Size of array with unique elements\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: BEST SUM\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ndef closest_sum_pair(nums, target):\n    nums.sort()\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    best_sum = float('inf')\n\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n        if abs(target - current_sum) < abs(best_sum - target):\n            best_sum = current_sum\n        if current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    return best_sum\n\n\n\nUSE CASES AND TYPES OF PROBLEMS\n\n * Unimodal: Problems admitting a single peak value (for instance, in mountain\n   arrays). Suitable for challenges aligned with binary search.\n * Anchors and Ships: Adaptable to problems where an anchored pointer supports\n   the movement of another, resembling the motion in a battleship game.\n * Linked Arrays: Optimal for tasks where a subarray in one array closely pairs,\n   area or merges, with one in another array.\n * Dynamic Techniques: Promising for string-related challenges, such as those\n   leveraging the appeal of palindromes.\n * Tared Targets: Suited to scenarios that necessitate the pursuit of k-closest\n   or similar.","index":25,"topic":" Arrays ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"27.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE TYPICAL USE CASES FOR USING AN ARRAY IN A SLIDING WINDOW ALGORITHM?","answer":"Sliding Window Algorithms make efficient use of arrays by defining a dynamic\nwindow to scan through elements.

Contiguous Data: Some tasks demand the analysis or manipulation of a\n    contiguous subset of elements in the array.\n 2. Input/Output Constraints: In some questions, the array serves a specific\n    purpose, such as acting as input for the algorithm or as the output from it.\n 3. Fixed Windows: In such tasks, the window size is fixed, and elements from\n    the array are processed in that window-sized block.\n 4. Collection Tasks: In certain problems, the task at hand involves gathering\n    information from a specific section of the array.\n 5.

The algorithm\ncalculates the sum of the first k elements, which is denoted as maxSum. Then, it\niterates through the remaining elements in the array, updating the tempSum value\nwithin the sliding window.

If the pivot itself is the\nKth smallest element, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, it restricts its\nsearch to one of the partitioned sections.\n\nBy combining the pivot selection, partitioning, and Kth element position check,\nQuickselect can efficiently solve problems like finding the median or the top K\nelements in an array.

However, their distinct nature\n   allows them to be advantageous in scenarios with duplicates.\n\n * Memory Usage: DNF uses a fixed set of three pointers to manipulate the array\n   in place, limiting its auxiliary memory usage.

Each element is associated with a priority level.\n\nMECHANISM\n\n * Insertion: Elements are typically added at the end of the array.

For our string, these would be\n   {\"BANANA\", \"ANANA\", \"NANA\", \"ANA\", \"NA\", \"A\"}.\n * Indices: The suffixes arranged in lexicographical order are mapped back to\n   the indices in the original string. For \"BANANA\", the suffixes in sorted\n   order are {\"A\", \"ANA\", \"ANANA\", \"BANANA\", \"NA\", \"NANA\"}.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION WITH ARRAYS\n\nUsing an example of the string \"BANANA\", we can see how the string itself, along\nwith the sorted suffixes and their corresponding indices, fit into three\ndifferent arrays.\n\n 1. String Array for Suffixes:\n    012345\"BANANA\"\"ANANA\"\"NANA\"\"ANA\"\"NA\"\"A\"\\begin{array}{ccccccc} 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\n    & 4 & 5\\\\ \"BANANA\" & \"ANANA\" & \"NANA\" & \"ANA\" & \"NA\" & \"A\"\n    \\end{array}0\"BANANA\" 1\"ANANA\" 2\"NANA\" 3\"ANA\" 4\"NA\" 5\"A\"\n\n 2.

LCP: Optional but quite useful.

These caches store frequently-accessed data.\n\n * Smaller caches can fully store only a portion of a large array, leading to\n   cache misses and degraded performance.\n\n\nCACHE LINE SIZE AND STRIDING\n\n * Data is moved from RAM to cache in fixed-size chunks known as cache lines.\n   When a cache line is loaded, the entire line is brought into the cache.\n\n * Memory misalignment and strided access (e.g., skipping elements) can lead to\n   cache inefficiencies, as multiple cache lines may be loaded unnecessarily.\n\n * When operations are performed across consecutive memory locations (in\n   physical or virtual memory), it is termed Temporal Locality, and the data\n   involved shows characteristics of Locality of Reference.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STRIDED ACCESS\n\nConsider this Python code:\n\narr = list(range(1, 101))  # Elements 1 to 100\n\n# Strided access (load every 10th element)\nfor i in range(0, 100, 10):\n    print(arr[i])\n\n\nIn the example above, elements 1, 11, 21, and so on are printed.

Here are some techniques to help reduce page faults when accessing\nlarge arrays.\n\n\nOPTIMIZING DATA ACCESS\n\n 1. Contiguous Memory Allocation: Arrange array elements in a way that minimizes\n    page faults during sequential access. Ideally, array elements should be\n    located in adjacent memory pages.\n\n 2. Hot-and-Cold Splitting: Separate frequently accessed data (hot) from\n    infrequently accessed data (cold). The cold data can be stored in a\n    different memory structure, optimizing for cache efficiency.\n\n 3. Memory Alignment: Align the memory addresses of array elements with the size\n    of a memory page or cache line. This ensures that multi-byte or multi-word\n    elements don't span multiple pages or cache lines.\n\n 4.
