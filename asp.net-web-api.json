Services are accessed via the standard\nHTTP methods:\n\n * GET: Retrieve data.\n * POST: Submit new data.\n * PUT: Update existing data.\n * DELETE: Remove data.\n\n\nCOMMON ELEMENTS\n\nRESOURCES\n\nResources such as APIs are identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs),\nserving as unique \"addresses\" for each resource.\n\nVERBS\n\nStandard HTTP verbs define basic operations. GET retrieves data, POST creates\nnew records, PUT updates them, and DELETE removes them.\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nData within a service is represented in a format, such as JSON or XML.\n\n\nASP.NET WEB API FOR RESTFUL SERVICES\n\n * Attribute-Based Routing: The framework lets developers define URI structures\n   through attributes.\n * Model Binding: Automatically extracts parameters from the request, enhancing\n   ease of use.\n * Content Negotiation: Allows for dynamic response formatting based on client\n   needs, enabling multiple output formats like JSON or XML.\n * ActionResult: A flexible return type that simplifies response handling, e.g.,\n   returning different HTTP status codes.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: RESTFUL SERVICES\n\nIn this example, a music library supports all standard CRUD (Create, Read,\nUpdate, Delete) operations.\n\npublic class MusicController : ApiController\n{\n    private List<Music> musics = new List<Music>();\n\n    // GET: api/Music\n    public IEnumerable<Music> GetAll()\n    {\n        return musics;\n    }\n\n    // GET: api/Music/5\n    public Music Get(int id)\n    {\n        return musics.FirstOrDefault(m => m.Id == id);\n    }\n\n    // POST: api/Music\n    public IHttpActionResult Post(Music music)\n    {\n        musics.Add(music);\n        return CreatedAtRoute(\"DefaultApi\", new { id = music.Id }, music);\n    }\n\n    // PUT: api/Music/5\n    public void Put(int id, Music music)\n    {\n        var existing = musics.FirstOrDefault(m => m.Id == id);\n        if (existing != null)\n        {\n            existing = music;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // DELETE: api/Music/5\n    public IHttpActionResult Delete(int id)\n    {\n        var music = musics.FirstOrDefault(m => m.Id == id);\n        if (music != null)\n        {\n            musics.Remove(music);\n            return Ok();\n        }\n        return NotFound();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Music\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Title { get; set; }\n    public string Artist { get; set; }\n    public int Duration { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nNote: This is a highly simplified example. In a production scenario, a service\nlike this would be backed by an actual data store or database.\n\nHere is the ASP.NET Razor form:\n\n   public IActionResult Index()\n        {\n            return View();\n        }\n\n\n * For GET, detail of all music objects can be obtained from the service by\n   calling GET: /api/Music.\n * For POST, new Music objects can be added by calling POST: /api/Music with the\n   details of the object in the request body.\n * For PUT, the ID of the existing Music object is specified in the URL, and the\n   updated Music object is sent in the request body, using URI path segment\n   (/api/music/5) and the HTTP method PUT.\n * For DELETE, the ID of the Music object to be deleted is specified in the URL,\n   using the URI path segment and the HTTP method DELETE.\n\nThe ApiControllers actions are automatically routed based on the HTTP method and\nthe structure of the requested URI.\n\nFor example, if a client sends an HTTP GET request to /api/music/5, the\nframework will invoke the Get action method on the MusicController, passing the\nid value of 5 from the request URI. Similarly, if a client sends a POST request\nto /api/music, the framework will invoke the Post method, and so on.","index":2,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT ARE HTTP VERBS AND HOW ARE THEY USED IN WEB API?","answer":"HTTP Verbs, also known as methods, dictate the type of action to be taken on a\nresource by a web server or Web API.

It typically\nuses the WebApiConfig and benefits from attribute-based routing.\n\n\nROUTE SETUP\n\n 1. Controller Route: The route to the entire controller. This is set up in the\n    WebApiConfig.cs file.\n    \n    Example: api/{controller}/{id}. In URI it would look like: /api/products/10.\n\n 2. Action Route: The route specific to an action method. This is configured via\n    attributes on the action methods.\n    \n    Example: [HttpGet(\"action/{id}\")]. In URI it would look like\n    /api/products/action/10.\n\n 3. HTTP Verb & Route: Both the HTTP Verb and the route need to match for the\n    request to be dispatched to the corresponding action.\n    \n    Example: [HttpGet(\"specificAction/{id}\")].\n\n 4. Default Values: They are useful for providing defaults for route parameters\n    and differentiating the route from others.\n    \n    Example: [HttpGet(\"actionWithDefault/{id:int=5}\")].\n\n 5. Additional Constraints: These can be added to route parameters for value\n    pattern matching and are especially useful for avoiding ambiguity between\n    different routes.\n    \n    Example: [Route(\"{id:int:range(1, 10)}\")].\n\n 6. Route Prefix: This is used via the [RoutePrefix] attribute at the controller\n    level. It allows you to set up a common route prefix for all action methods\n    within the controller. This is often used for versioning.\n    \n    Example: [RoutePrefix(\"api/V2/products\")].\n\n\nROUTE MAPPING SCENARIOS\n\nCONTROLLER ROUTES\n\n * Default: All action methods within the controller will use this default\n   route.\n * Custom: You can use the [Route] attribute to specify a custom route for the\n   entire controller.\n\nACTION ROUTES\n\n * Custom: Assign a custom route to the action method by using the [Route]\n   attribute.\n * Override: Using the [Route] attribute provides the ability to override any\n   route conventions set at the controller level.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ROUTE SETUP\n\nHere are the code examples:\n\nController class:\n\n[RoutePrefix(\"api/products\")]\npublic class ProductsController : ApiController\n{\n    //Matches GET api/products/1\n    [Route(\"{id:int:min(1)}\")]\n    public HttpResponseMessage GetProduct(int id)\n    {\n    }\n    \n    //Matches GET api/products/category/123\n    [Route(\"category/{id}\")]\n    public HttpResponseMessage GetByCategory(string id)\n    {\n    }\n    \n    [HttpGet]\n    public List<Product> GetAllProducts()\n    {\n    }\n}\n\n\nWebApiConfig.cs:\n\npublic static class WebApiConfig\n{\n    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)\n    {\n        config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();\n        config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(\n            name: \"DefaultApi\",\n            routeTemplate: \"api/{controller}/{id}\",\n            defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }\n        );\n    }\n}\n","index":5,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nHOW ARE REQUESTS MAPPED TO ACTIONS IN WEB API?","answer":"In ASP.NET Web API, actions are identified using combination of HTTP method and\nrequest URL.\n\n\nACTION SELECTION\n\nWeb API action selection occurs in two stages:\n\n 1. Mapping to Resource: The request URL, including query string, if any, is\n    used to route to a particular resource.\n 2. Mapping to Action: The HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.) of a request further\n    directs the routing to a specific action on the resource.\n\nThis two-tiered approach is designed to mirror the RESTful resource structure\nand the HTTP method semantics.\n\nROUTE GENERATION AND MATCHING\n\nWeb API leverages the powerful ASP.NET routing engine to parse the request URL\nand match the URL against a Route Table to identify the relevant resource.\n\nATTRIBUTE AND CONVENTIONAL ROUTING\n\nWeb API supports both attribute-based and conventional routes for mapping URL\nsegments to actions and controllers.\n\n * Attribute Routing: Methods are adorned with [Route] attributes, explicitly\n   defining the URL template.\n * Conventional Routing: URL paths are matched using a set of conventions.\n\nWhile Attribute Routing provides more granular control, Conventional Routing is\noften simpler to set up.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ACTION SELECTION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class EmployeesController : ApiController\n{\n    [Route(\"api/employees/{id}\")]\n    public Employee GetEmployee(int id)\n    {\n        // Retrieve employee based on ID\n    }\n\n    [Route(\"api/employees\")]\n    public IEnumerable<Employee> GetEmployees()\n    {\n        // Retrieve all employees\n    }\n\n    [Route(\"api/employees\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult PostEmployee(Employee employee)\n    {\n        // Add new employee\n    }\n}\n","index":6,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nWHAT IS CONTENT NEGOTIATION IN THE CONTEXT OF WEB API?","answer":"Content negotiation and media type formatter together allow ASP.NET Web API to\nserve multiple responses based on the requesting client's preferences.

Attribute routing offers improved\nflexibility, granular control, and maintenance simplicity by allowing for\nroute-to-action mapping at the method level, directly within the controller,\nusing intuitive and dedicated attributes.\n\n\nKEY ATTRIBUTES FOR ROUTE CONFIGURATION\n\n * RoutePrefix: Serves as a prefix for all routes defined within a specific\n   controller. This makes it easy to group related actions under a shared route\n   segment.\n * Route: Marks individual actions with specific route templates.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ATTRIBUTE ROUTING\n\nHere is the controller code:\n\n[RoutePrefix(\"api/books\")]\npublic class BooksController : ApiController\n{\n    // Route will be: api/books\n    [Route(\"\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult GetBooks() { /* ... */ }\n\n    // Route will be: api/books/5\n    [Route(\"{id:int}\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult GetBookById(int id) { /* ... */ }\n\n    // Route will be: api/books/5/author\n    [Route(\"{id:int}/author\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult GetBookAuthor(int id) { /* ... */ }\n\n    // Route will be: api/books\n    [Route(\"\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult PostBook([FromBody] Book book) { /* ... */ }\n\n    // Route will be: api/books/5\n    [Route(\"{id:int}\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult PutBook(int id, [FromBody] Book book) { /* ... */ }\n\n    // Route will be: api/books/5\n    [Route(\"{id:int}\")]\n    public IHttpActionResult DeleteBook(int id) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n\nIn the above example:\n\n * The RoutePrefix attribute, on the BooksController, declares a common prefix\n   for all methods within BooksController.\n * The Route attributes, on individual methods, define specific route templates\n   relative to the prefix set by RoutePrefix.\n\n\nCOMBINING ATTRIBUTE AND CONVENTIONAL ROUTING\n\nYou can use both attribute routing and conventional routing in the same\napplication, but it's generally preferred to stick to one method for consistency\nand to avoid potential confusion.","index":14,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"16.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE VERSIONING IN WEB API?","answer":"Web API makes use of Media Type headers along with specific routes to handle\nversioning in a convenient and flexible manner.\n\n\nURI-BASED VERSIONING\n\nThis method stipulates the API version directly within the URI.\n\n * Advantages: Simple and clear for testing; especially useful for new API\n   versions.\n * Disadvantages: Bloats URIs, making them less readable.\n\n\nHEADERS-BASED VERSIONING\n\nInstead of altering the URI, this versioning method relies on setting the\npreferred version through the Accept header.\n\n * Advantages: Doesn't clutter the URI; suitable for more complex version\n   setups.\n * Disadvantages: Might require careful configuration to ensure header\n   transmission.\n\n\nPARAMETER-BASED VERSIONING\n\nThis method entails the inclusion of version details through method parameters\nor query strings.\n\n * Advantages: Allows for versioning without much URI or header modification.\n * Disadvantages: Might result in clashes with other query parameters in the\n   URL.\n\n\nCONTENT NEGOTIATION\n\nWith content negotiation, your API selects and delivers the most appropriate\nrepresentation of the resource based on the client's media type header. These\nheaders are often auto-generated by client libraries or certain applications.\n\n * Advantages: Removes the need for explicit versioning in many cases, helping\n   to keep your API more standardized and clean.\n * Disadvantages: Could lead to unexpected behavior if version differences\n   aren't carefully managed.\n\n\nACCEPT HEADER VERSIONING\n\nBy default, Web API supports Accept header versioning, which involves clients\nsending the Accept header with the desired media type. However, you may want to\nutilize a more explicit header, like api-version.\n\nTo implement versioning, you can opt for a custom header like api-version.\n\nCONFIGURATION USING NUGET PACKAGES\n\nTwo popular NuGet packages are used for this type of global configuration:\n\n 1. WebApiContrib.Core\n 2. WebApiContrib.Formatting.Json\n\n * Build Details: Add the NuGet reference, select the package appropriate for\n   the project, and build the application.\n\n * Code Example-1: Register the formatter for the version header.\n\nGlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SupportedMediaTypes\n.Add(new MediaTypeHeaderValue(\"application/json\"));\n\n\n * Code Example-2: Define a custom IApiVersionReader, responsible for reading\n   the version information from the request.\n\nvar headerApiVersionReader = new HeaderApiVersionReader(\"api-version\");\nc.VersionReader(headerApiVersionReader);\n\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Simplicity: Select the most straightforward versioning strategy that aligns\n   with your API's needs.\n * Consistency: Stay consistent. Seek a style that is predictable and easy to\n   understand for both developers and clients alike.\n * Documentation: Always document your versioning strategy and ensure client\n   developers are well-informed.\n\nBefore the feature is available, there are a number of ways to manage\nversioning, such as HTTP headers (name and accept), query string parameters, and\nURI path parameters. For basic scenarios, you can use the namespace attribute.\nThe majority of cases may warrant returning the version information with HTTP\nheaders (for example using content negotiation through ItemStack and Accept\nheaders).\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE-5: SPECIFY VERSION IN URL\n\n[HttpGet, Route(\"api/books/{id:int}/{version:apiVersion}\")]\npublic HttpResponseMessage GetBook(int id) { }\n\n\nOr, with query strings:\n\n[HttpGet, Route(\"api/books/{id:int}\")]\npublic HttpResponseMessage GetBook(int id, ApiVersion version) { }\n\n\nFor the URI-based parameter:\n\n[HttpGet, Route(\"api/books/{id:int}/{version}\")]\npublic HttpResponseMessage GetBook(int id, string version) { }\n","index":15,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"17.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE DIFFERENT RESPONSE STATUS CODES IN WEB API?","answer":"ASP.NET Web API allows for a fine-tuned representation of HTTP status codes. The\nresponse status code is augmented by a response body and custom headers.\n\n\nRESPONSE GENERATION MECHANISMS\n\n * Manually Created Responses: The application developer takes complete control\n   over the response generation process.\n\n * Exception Handling with HTTP Response Codes: A mechanism for translating\n   exceptions into specific HTTP responses.\n\n\nBASICS OF HTTP STATUS CODES\n\nHTTP defines several status codes divided into 5 categories:\n\n * 1xx (Informational): The request is in progress, and the server is\n   communicating its status to the client.\n * 2xx (Success): The server successfully processed the request.\n * 3xx (Redirection): Further action is needed to complete the request.\n * 4xx (Client Error): The client request contains bad syntax or cannot be\n   fulfilled.\n * 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.\n\n\nEXCEPTION HANDLING IN WEB API\n\nIn ASP.NET Web API, throwing an HttpResponseException will return the specified\nstatus code along with an appropriate response message.\n\nHere's an example:\n\npublic class ProductsController : ApiController\n{\n    public Product Get(int id)\n    {\n        var product = _data.GetProduct(id);\n\n        if (product == null)\n            throw new HttpResponseException(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);\n\n        return product;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nGLOBAL EXCEPTION HANDLER\n\nTo implement a method that uniformly handles exceptions throughout the\napplication, you can define a class deriving from IExceptionHandler. By\noverriding the method Handle, you can decide how to respond to various\nexceptions.\n\nHere is the class definition:\n\npublic class GlobalExceptionHandler : IExceptionHandler\n{\n    public Task HandleAsync(ExceptionHandlerContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n    {\n        // Log the exception\n        Debug.WriteLine(context.Exception);\n\n        // Handle specific exceptions and return an HTTP response\n        if (context.Exception is CustomNotFoundException)\n        {\n            var response = context.Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, \"The resource you are looking for does not exist\");\n            context.Result = new ExceptionResult(response, this);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            var response = context.Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, \"An unexpected error occurred on the server\");\n            context.Result = new ExceptionResult(response, this);\n        }\n        return Task.CompletedTask;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nINSPECTING HEADERS AND BODIES\n\nYou can control the response in more detail by directly manipulating headers and\nthe body content:\n\n * HttpResponseMessage: This class provides fine-grained control over the\n   response.\n\nExample:\n\npublic HttpResponseMessage Post(Product product)\n{\n    if (product == null)\n        return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);\n\n    _data.AddProduct(product);\n    var response = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.Created);\n    response.Content = new StringContent(\"Product created successfully\", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8, \"text/plain\");\n    response.Headers.Location = new Uri(Url.Link(\"GetProductById\", new { id = product.Id }));\n    return response;\n}\n\n\n * Request.CreateResponse: A factory method belonging to the HttpRequestMessage\n   class that can create and customize HttpResponseMessage instances.\n\nExample:\n\nreturn Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.ExpectationFailed, \"Product expectation failed\");\n\n\n\nBENEFITS OF USING SPECIFIC STATUS CODES\n\n * Improved Caching: Different statuses can influence client-side and\n   server-side caching behaviors.\n\n * SEO Considerations: In web applications, the 200 status code is associated\n   with content being successfully served. statusCode.\n\n * Problem-Specific Reporting: Certain status codes are tailored to specific\n   problems. For instance, 400 Bad Request lets the client know there's a\n   problem with their request.","index":16,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"18.\n\n\nWHAT IS IHTTPACTIONRESULT, AND HOW DOES IT WORK IN ACTION RESULTS?","answer":"In ASP.NET Web API, the IHttpActionResult interface serves as an abstraction\nthat decouples the controllers from the specific HTTP responses they generate.\n\nRather than directly returning HttpResponseMessage objects, which can lead to\ncode duplication and testing complexities, you can use IHttpActionResult to\nencapsulate the logic for returning HTTP responses.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Abstraction: Deals with HTTP requests and responses in a more abstract\n   manner.\n * Testability: Provides a standardized way to test action results.\n * Async Compatibility: Supports asynchronous operations with Task return types.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Code Reusability: You can encapsulate common action response logic in custom\n   IHttpActionResult implementations.\n * Simplicity: By using dedicated methods based on the required result, such as\n   Ok() or BadRequest(), you ensure consistent response generation.\n\n\nCORE METHODS\n\n * ExecuteAsync: This method returns an HttpResponseMessage asynchronously when\n   implemented.\n\n * Template Methods: Most IHttpActionResult implementations offer methods like\n   ExecuteAsync, which are solid templates for common results.\n\n\nKNOWN IMPLEMENTATIONS\n\n * OkResult: Returns 200 OK.\n * RedirectResult: Initiates a redirection.\n * BadRequestResult: Returns a \"400\" status code.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: HTTP GET WITH IHTTPACTIONRESULT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// PUT: api/Product/5\n[HttpPut]\npublic IHttpActionResult PutProduct(int id, Product product)\n{\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)  // Allowing ModelState to handle validation\n        return BadRequest(ModelState);\n\n    if (id != product.Id)\n        return BadRequest(\"Parameter ID does not match object ID.\");\n\n    try\n    {\n        // Updating Product\n        repository.Update(product); \n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        return InternalServerError(ex);\n    }\n\n    return Ok(\"Product record updated successfully.\");\n}\n","index":17,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"19.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU READ DATA FROM THE QUERY STRING IN WEB API?","answer":"In ASP.NET Web API, you can obtain data from the query string using the\nHttpRequestMessage.\n\n\nQUICK ACCESS WITH EXTENSION METHOD\n\nThe HttpRequestMessage class offers an Extension method called\nGetQueryNameValuePairs for quick access to the query string.\n\nHere is the C# code to achieve that:\n\npublic HttpResponseMessage Get(HttpRequestMessage request)\n{\n    var queryStrings = request.GetQueryNameValuePairs()\n        .ToDictionary(kv => kv.Key, kv => kv.Value);\n\n    // Access the query string parameters.\n    if (queryStrings.ContainsKey(\"id\"))\n    {\n        var id = queryStrings[\"id\"];\n        // Perform actions with the id.\n    }\n\n    return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);\n}\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE METHOD: HTTPCONTEXT.CURRENT.REQUEST\n\nAnother method saves the URL's segment containing the path components. It uses\nHttpContext.Current.Request to obtain the query string.\n\nHowever, it's better to leverage the Request Context or HttpRequestMessage. The\nlatter provides more robust testing capabilities and can be conveniently used in\nunit tests, unlike HttpContext.Current.Request.\n\nIn C#, the alternative code is:\n\npublic HttpResponseMessage Get(int id)\n{\n    var request = HttpContext.Current.Request;\n\n    // Access the 'id' parameter from the query string.\n    var queryId = request.QueryString[\"id\"];\n\n    return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);\n}\n\n\n\nDATA MODEL BINDING\n\nFor more complex scenarios, you can use Data Model Binding. By including your\nparameter in the method signature, Web API will automatically bind query string\ndata.\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic HttpResponseMessage Get(int id, string filter, int? pageNumber, int? pageSize)\n{\n    // Access id, filter, pageNumber, pageSize, etc.\n\n    return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);\n}\n\n\nWhen sending a request with a URL like\n/api/controller?id=123&filter=interest&pageNumber=1 on the Web API, it will\nautomatically bind the query string values to the corresponding parameters in\nthe method signature.","index":18,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"20.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE USE OF REQUEST AND RESPONSE MESSAGE CLASSES.","answer":"In the context of ASP.NET Web API, the Request and Response message classes play\ncrucial roles in handling HTTP requests and responses.

You can customize the\nserialization process using JsonSerializerSettings.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: JSON SERIALIZATION SETTINGS\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class ProductsController : ApiController\n{\n    public IHttpActionResult GetProduct()\n    {\n        var product = new Product() { Name = \"Laptop\", Price = 1000 }; // Your product object\n        return Ok(product);\n    }\n}\n\npublic static class WebApiConfig\n{\n    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)\n    {\n        var jsonFormatter = config.Formatters.OfType<JsonMediaTypeFormatter>().First();\n        jsonFormatter.SerializerSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings\n        {\n            NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore,\n            DateFormatHandling = DateFormatHandling.MicrosoftDateFormat\n        };\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nCONTENT NEGOTIATION\n\nWeb API supports content negotiation, allowing it to select a formatter based on\ncriteria like the client's Accept header.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONTENT NEGOTIATION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic static class WebApiConfig\n{\n    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)\n    {\n        config.Formatters.Remove(config.Formatters.XmlFormatter);  // Remove XML formatter\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nDATA ANNOTATIONS\n\nBy using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations classes and annotations like\n[Required], [StringLength], and [Display], you can customize the serialization\nof your domain objects.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DATA ANNOTATIONS FOR CUSTOMIZING SERIALIZATION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class Product\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    \n    [Display(Name = \"Product Price\")]\n    public decimal Price { get; set; }\n}\n","index":23,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"25.\n\n\nWHAT ARE MEDIA TYPE FORMATTERS IN WEB API?","answer":"A media type formatter in ASP.NET Web API inspects the type of data being\nreceived or sent by an API endpoint, and it serializes or deserializes the data\naccordingly. It also sets the Content-Type and Accept headers to match the\nexpected or supplied data.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Media type: Refers to the type of content being transmitted or received, such\n   as XML, JSON, or text.\n\n * Formatter: A mechanism that transforms the data between its native type and\n   the chosen media type. Web API ships with the following formatters:\n   JsonMediaTypeFormatter, XmlMediaTypeFormatter, and\n   FormUrlEncodedMediaTypeFormatter.\n\n\nCUSTOM FORMATTERS\n\nYou have the flexibility to implement custom formatters if the built-in ones\ndon't meet your requirements. For example, you might need to communicate using a\nnewer, specialized data type.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CUSTOM FORMATTER\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class CustomFormatter : MediaTypeFormatter\n{\n    public CustomFormatter()\n    {\n        this.SupportedMediaTypes.Add(new MediaTypeHeaderValue(\"application/customType\"));\n    }\n\n    public override bool CanReadType(Type type)\n    {\n        return type == typeof(MyCustomType);\n    }\n\n    public override bool CanWriteType(Type type)\n    {\n        return type == typeof(MyCustomType);\n    }\n\n    public override Task<object> ReadFromStreamAsync(Type type, Stream readStream, HttpContent content, IFormatterLogger formatterLogger, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n    {\n        // Deserialize from the stream\n    }\n\n    public override Task WriteToStreamAsync(Type type, object value, Stream writeStream, HttpContent content, TransportContext transportContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n    {\n        // Serialize to the stream\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nJSON.NET FORMATTER\n\nWeb API leverages Json.NET under the hood for its JSON serialization. By\ndefault, the JsonMediaTypeFormatter uses this tool.\n\nJson.NET deserves accolades for its flexibility and powerful features, such as\nserialization naming strategies. When necessary, you can turn off Json.NET's\ncore features, such as using camelCase for properties.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhile Web API promotes the use of media type formatters, keep in mind that they\ncan introduce overhead. Formatters dynamically determine the right serializer to\nuse, which involves some related computations and operations.\n\nFurthermore, built-in formatters like JsonMediaTypeFormatter and\nXmlMediaTypeFormatter have their own sets of trade-offs. Customizing the\nserialization process or switching to dedicated formatters can optimize\nperformance.\n\nFor scenarios prioritizing speed, consider using direct serializers like\nJsonSerializer or XmlSerializer instead of Web API's formatters.","index":24,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"26.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SUPPORT XML OR JSON, OR OTHER FORMATS AS A RESPONSE IN WEB API?","answer":"ASP.NET Web API is flexible in response formats but typically uses JSON by\ndefault.

Content-Type and Accept Headers: Used by most HTTP-based APIs, clients\n    request a specific representation through the Accept header and provide data\n    in the expected format through the Content-Type header when making changes.\n\n 2. Media-Type Formatters: These are responsible for translating HTTP messages\n    into the desired format. XML and JSON formatters are built-in, but you can\n    create custom ones as well.\n\n 3. Exception Handling: When unable to serve the requested format due to the\n    absence of a suitable media formatter, the Web API responds with an HTTP 406\n    Not Acceptable error.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: XML AND JSON CONTENT NEGOTIATION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class ProductsController : ApiController\n{\n    // GET api/products\n    public IEnumerable<Product> GetProducts()\n    {\n        return new List<Product>()\n        {\n            new Product(){ Id = 1, Name = \"Product 1\", Price = 10.0M},\n            new Product(){ Id = 2, Name = \"Product 2\", Price = 20.0M},\n            new Product(){ Id = 3, Name = \"Product 3\", Price = 30.0M}\n        };\n    }\n\n    // Other controllers/actions...\n\n    public HttpResponseMessage PostProduct(Product product)\n    {\n        SaveProduct(product);\n\n        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, product);\n\n        // Example of forcing a specific content-type response\n        // Commenting this line will make the API route to a formatter based on the accept header.\n        response.Content = new ObjectContent<Product>(\n            product,  // type of response\n            new System.Net.Http.Formatting.JsonMediaTypeFormatter(), // media formatter\n            \"application/json\" // media type\n        );\n\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, GetProducts can return either JSON or XML based on the client's\nAccept header, while PostProduct returns JSON regardless of the client's Accept\nheader.","index":25,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"27.\n\n\nWHAT IS BSON AND HOW CAN IT BE USED WITH WEB API?","answer":"Binary JSON (BSON) is a data format designed for high-performance operations.\nWhile primarily associated with MongoDB, you can also use it in a RESTful\narchitecture, particularly with ASP.NET Web API.\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF USING BSON\n\n * Serialization Speed: BSON is quicker to serialize and deserialize, making it\n   preferable for systems that demand high throughput.\n * Efficient Storage: The binary format is memory efficient, especially for\n   metrics and logs.\n\n\nINTEGRATING BSON WITH WEB API\n\nYou can simply adapt the content negotiation process to include BSON.\n\nWebApiConfig.cs:\n\npublic static void Configure(HttpConfiguration config) {\n    config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SupportedMediaTypes\n        .Add(new MediaTypeHeaderValue(\"application/bson\"));\n}\n\n\nController Method:\n\npublic HttpResponseMessage Get() {\n    HttpResponseMessage response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, yourData);\n    response.Content = new ObjectContent<DataModel>(yourData, new BsonMediaTypeFormatter());\n    return response;\n}\n\n\n\nADDING SUPPORT FOR BSON IN WEB API\n\n 1.

Moq: A powerful, lightweight mocking framework.\n\n 3. FluentAssertions The library utilizes a more natural, readable syntax for\n    asserting test conditions.\n\n 4. NUnit or MSTest: Also effective for unit testing in Web API applications.\n\n 5. WebApplicationFactory: A feature in ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later for launching\n    the application and setting up an in-memory test server. This is immensely\n    beneficial for integration testing.\n\n 6. TestServer: For running an in-memory test server. It is built into .NET Core\n    and simplifies making HTTP calls to the Web API without needing an actual\n    network stack.\n\n 7. HttpClient: For end-to-end testing, especially for asserting the behavior of\n    the Web API when receiving HTTP requests.\n\n 8.

Integration Testing: This method provides a more realistic environment but\n    can be slower and less predictable. It connects to a real server and\n    database to make requests and check responses.\n\n 2. In-Memory Testing: This approach is quicker and more controlled. It\n    primarily checks that the request is routed correctly and an expected\n    response is returned.\n\n 3. Mocking: You can use mocking libraries such as Moq to test the interactions\n    between the API and its dependencies in isolation.\n\n\nTIPS FOR EFFICIENT TESTING\n\n * Test Scenarios, Not Code: Focus on testing how the API behaves under\n   different conditions rather than testing its internal mechanisms.\n\n * Automate Where Possible: Rely on tools like xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest to\n   automate the execution of your tests.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: INTEGRATION TEST\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[TestMethod]\npublic async Task Get_Returns_Correct_Item()\n{\n    // Arrange - create an in-memory test server\n    var server = new TestServer(WebApiConfig.Register);\n    var client = server.HttpClient;\n\n    // Act - make an HTTP GET request to the server\n    var response = await client.GetAsync(\"api/items/1\");\n    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();  // Throw on error status code\n\n    // Assert - ensure the response matches what's expected\n    var item = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<Item>();\n    Assert.AreEqual(\"Expected Item Name\", item.Name);\n}\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IN-MEMORY TEST\n\nHere is another C# code example:\n\n[TestMethod]\npublic void GetItems_Returns_All_Items()\n{\n    // Arrange - create a controller instance and add items\n    var controller = new ItemsController();\n\n    // Act - call the GetItems method\n    var result = controller.GetItems();\n\n    // Assert - verify the result matches expectations\n    Assert.IsNotNull(result);\n    Assert.AreEqual(3, result.Count());\n}\n","index":35,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"37.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU INTEGRATE ENTITY FRAMEWORK WITH WEB API?","answer":"Entity Framework (EF) provides a convenient way to perform database operations\nusing model entities, while ASP.NET Web API facilitates the creation of HTTP\nservices. Combining these technologies allows the seamless handling of data\noperations via API endpoints.\n\n\nINTEGRATING EF WITH WEB API\n\n 1. Install Entity Framework: Use the Package Manager Console to install EF if\n    it's not present in the project:\n    \n    Install-Package EntityFramework\n    \n\n 2. Create an EF Data Model: Implement the DbContext class that represents the\n    database context and manages the database connection.\n\n 3. CRUD Operations with EF and Web API:\n    \n    * Retrieve Data: Use DbContext to query the database and return entities to\n      the API controller, which, in turn, responds with the data.\n    \n    * Add or Update Data: The API controller receives data from clients, adding\n      or updating entities in the DbContext, and then calling SaveChanges to\n      persist the changes to the database.\n    \n    * Delete Data: After receiving the entity's unique identifier from the\n      client, the API controller ensures that the entity is removed from the\n      database using the DbContext before calling SaveChanges.\n\n 4. Control Data Serialization: By leveraging JsonObject and JsonIgnore\n    attributes in model classes, you can fine-tune data serialization to and\n    from JSON. Additionally, EF supports lazy or eager loading strategies to\n    manage related data retrieval.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: PERSISTENCE OPERATIONS\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class MyDbContext : DbContext\n{\n    public MyDbContext() : base(\"name=MyDbContextConnection\") { }\n    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class UserController : ApiController\n{\n    private MyDbContext context = new MyDbContext();\n\n    [HttpGet]\n    public IEnumerable<User> GetUsers()\n    {\n        return context.Users.ToList();\n    }\n\n    [HttpPost]\n    public IHttpActionResult AddUser(User user)\n    {\n        context.Users.Add(user);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n        return Ok(\"User added successfully\");\n    }\n\n    [HttpPut]\n    public IHttpActionResult UpdateUser(int userId, User user)\n    {\n        if (userId != user.UserId)\n            return BadRequest(\"User ID mismatch\");\n        \n        context.Entry(user).State = EntityState.Modified;\n        context.SaveChanges();\n        return Ok(\"User updated successfully\");\n    }\n\n    [HttpDelete]\n    public IHttpActionResult DeleteUser(int userId)\n    {\n        User user = context.Users.Find(userId);\n        if (user == null)\n            return NotFound();\n\n        context.Users.Remove(user);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n        return Ok(\"User deleted successfully\");\n    }\n}\n","index":36,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"38.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE BEST PRACTICES FOR USING ENTITY FRAMEWORK WITH WEB API.","answer":"Let's look at two primary categories of Best Practices for utilizing Entity\nFramework in the context of Web API.\n\n\nDATA HANDLING AND RESPONSE OPTIMIZATION\n\n 1. Avoid Overfetching and Underfetching: Employ techniques like Select,\n    ProjectTo with libraries like AutoMapper, or dedicated POCOs to transmit\n    only required data.\n\n 2. Manage Change Tracking: Be disciplined about how EF tracks changes to\n    entities. Use AsNoTracking to treat entities as read-only and only call\n    SaveChanges for entities you intend to persist changes to.\n\n 3. Non-Blocking Operations: Use async methods to avoid unnecessary thread\n    blocking. This is crucial in high-traffic scenarios.\n\n 4. Pagination: Utilize built-in pagination methods such as Skip and Take for\n    efficient data retrieval.\n\n 5. Consider Caching: Weigh the benefits of data caching to reduce the need for\n    frequent database calls. Configure caching policies for each type of data to\n    limit potential staleness.\n\n 6. Deviding Concerns: Minimize exposure of internal classes and methods.\n    Present a controlled set of functionality to the outside world.\n\n\nCODE AND SECURITY BEST PRACTICES\n\n 1. Use of HttpGet vs HttpPost: While fetching data typically uses HttpGet, be\n    mindful about inadvertent data transmissions via URL and logging mechanisms.\n    Prefer HttpPost for secure data transmission.\n\n 2. Data Verification: Before persisting data, validate its integrity and\n    conformity to relevant specifications.\n\n 3. Attribute Routing for Safety: Leverage attribute routing to achieve safety\n    for sensitive routes.\n\n 4. Encapsulate EF with Repository: The repository is effective for data\n    operations and provides valuable abstractions.\n\n 5. Complex Types Handling: Prefer using DTOs for endpoints returning complex\n    data types, especially in JsonResult.\n\n 6. Exception Management: Ensure that exceptions are handled systematically,\n    providing meaningful responses without compromising sensitive data.\n\n 7.

ODataQueryOptions: This provides a way to parse and apply OData query\n    options, such as Select, Expand, and Filter.\n\n 2. ODataQueryAttribute: By decorating the Web API action methods' parameters\n    with this attribute, developers can enable clients to send OData queries as\n    part of the URI.\n\n 3. OData Model: This is an integral component representing the API's data model\n    and containing references to classes, properties, and methods that the API\n    is designed to expose.\n\n\nENABLING ODATA IN WEB API\n\nThe setup process involves several steps.\n\n 1. Data Model Definition: Define the data model using a technology that Web API\n    supports. This is typically Entity Framework or \"POCO\" classes.\n\n 2. OData Enablement: To enable OData, configure the data model with entity sets\n    and expose them through an \\[\\[ ODataController \\]]:\n    \n    [EnableQuery]\n    public IQueryable<Customer> GetCustomers()\n    {\n        return db.Customers;\n    }\n    \n\n 3. OData Routing: Use the MapODataServiceRoute method in your application's\n    startup code to register OData routes.\n    \n    config.MapODataServiceRoute(\"odata\", \"odata\", GetEdmModel());\n    \n\n 4. Consuming: To consume the API using OData, clients can construct requests\n    following OData conventions. For example, to retrieve Customers with the\n    Name property starting with \"A\", the request would be:\n    \n    http://server/odata/Customers?$filter=startswith(Name, 'A') eq true\n\n\nDATA MODEL CONFIGURATION\n\n * EntitySetConfiguration: This class represents a configuration for a single\n   entity set of a particular type.

It can be configured at the controller or action level.\n\n * Custom Caching: You can create your own caching mechanisms tailored to your\n   specific needs and infrastructure.\n\n * Async Caching: Enables asynchronous cache reads and writes to allow your\n   application to continue running while the cache is being accessed or updated.\n   This is crucial for high-throughput applications and can be especially useful\n   with distributed caches like Redis.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CACHE-CONTROL HEADERS\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic HttpResponseMessage GetCachedData()\n{\n    var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, data);\n\n    response.Headers.CacheControl = new CacheControlHeaderValue\n    {\n        Public = true,\n        MaxAge = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60)\n    };\n\n    return response;\n}\n\n\nIn this example, the response is marked as cacheable in public caches for 60\nseconds. The CacheControlHeaderValue object exposes various cache-directive\nproperties that you can set based on your specific caching requirements.\n\nFor in-depth control over Cache-Control headers, you can directly manipulate the\nCacheControl property of the HttpResponseMessage object.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING OUTPUTCACHE ATTRIBUTE\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class DataController : ApiController\n{\n    // Cache the output for 60 seconds\n    [HttpGet]\n    [OutputCache(Duration = 60)]\n    public IEnumerable<Data> GetCachedData()\n    {\n        return data;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, both the GetCachedData method and its returned data will be\ncached for 60 seconds, enhancing performance for subsequent requests.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: IN-MEMORY CACHING\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nprivate readonly MemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(\"dataCache\");\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic IEnumerable<Data> GetCachedData()\n{\n    const string cacheKey = \"cachedData\";\n\n    if (_cache.Contains(cacheKey))\n    {\n        return _cache.Get(cacheKey) as IEnumerable<Data>;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        var data = GetDataFromDatabase();\n        _cache.Set(cacheKey, data, DateTimeOffset.Now.AddMinutes(5));\n        return data;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, the MemoryCache class stores data in the application's memory\nand provides methods to set, retrieve, and remove cached items.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL PITFALLS\n\n * Over-caching: Be cautious about caching resources or data that change\n   frequently.\n\n * Under-caching: Selective caching is key.

After setting up the system\nusing IIS, client applications must provide Windows credentials for every\nrequest.\n\nBASIC AUTHENTICATION\n\nDespite its simplicity, using Basic Authentication, the username and password\nare sent in the clear without encryption on every request. This method is\nconsidered less secure and should be avoided unless the communication is already\nover an encrypted channel, like HTTPS.\n\n$.ajax({\n    url: 'https://myapi.com/data',\n    type: 'GET',\n    dataType: 'json',\n    beforeSend: function(xhr) {\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Authorization\", \"Basic \" + btoa(\"username:password\"));\n    },\n    success: function(data) {\n        console.log(data);\n    }\n});\n\n\nTOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION\n\nThis mechanism employs a unique token linked to a specific user. After\nsuccessful username and password verification, the server sends an\nauthentication token, which clients then submit with each request. This approach\nis highly flexible and is a preferred choice for many modern web applications.\n\nJSON WEB TOKEN (JWT)\n\nJWT is a prevalent token-based authentication method that ensures data\nintegrity, authenticity, and confidentiality. It's based on secure, efficient,\nand well-structured claim-based tokens.\n\nOnce validated by the server, tokens grant access without necessitating further\ncredential checks.\n\nHere's a simplified example:\n\n 1. The client passes credentials to the server.\n 2. The server authenticates and generates a JWT.\n\nIn the next steps, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header. The\nJWT contains the user data needed for future requests, such as their ID and\nrole.\n\n$.ajax({\n    url: 'https://myapi.com/data',\n    type: 'GET',\n    dataType: 'json',\n    beforeSend: function(xhr) {\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \" + your_jwt_token_here);\n    },\n    success: function(data) {\n        console.log(data);\n    }\n});\n\n\nThe server, upon receiving the JWT, decodes and verifies its authenticity. If\nsuccessful, the server proceeds with the request, using the user data enclosed\nin the token.\n\nOAUTH 2.0\n\nOAuth 2.0 delegates user authorization from a web application to a service\nresponsible for holding the credentials. Often associated with third-party\nsign-ins, like \"Log in with Google\" or \"Log in with Facebook\", OAuth 2.0\nstreamlines the user account handling process.\n\nAfter authentication through an external service, the client is assigned an\naccess token. The client comprises the token—a form of identity proof—to confirm\nits authorization and make requests to the API.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * For enhanced security, it’s strongly recommended to rely on token-based\n   systems, particularly JWT, in tandem with HTTPS.\n\n * Incorporate multi-factor authentication for heightened data security.","index":47,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"49.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT OAUTH2 AUTHORIZATION IN WEB API?","answer":"OAuth assures secure, delegated access to web resources.

It\nenables clients to specify the version of the API they wish to consume and gives\nyou, the developers, the freedom to evolve APIs without breaking existing\nclients.\n\nThrough best practices, you can effectively achieve API versioning.\n\n\nTYPES OF VERSIONING\n\n * URI-based: Embed version information directly within the URI like\n   api/v1/resource. This approach is straightforward but results in URI\n   pollution.\n * Media type-based: Also known as content negotiation. It separates versions\n   using MIME types. For instance, Accept: application/json;v=2. This approach\n   avoids URI pollution but might be difficult to implement as a default header\n   in some clients.\n * Custom header-based: Uses custom headers like api_version: 1. It separates\n   version information in a non-URI specific way. This method doesn't pollute\n   the URI and can be required in the request.\n * Query parameter-based: Appends a version query parameter to the URI like\n   api/resource?v=2. This method might cause caching issues and isn't considered\n   best practice.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n1. USE A CONSISTENT VERSIONING SCHEME\n\nAvoid a mix of versioning strategies within your API. This can create\nfrustration and inconsistency for developers and clients. Choose one strategy\nthat aligns with your needs and sticks to it.\n\n2. EMPLOY SEMANTIC VERSIONING\n\nThis practice follows a structured numbering system like major.minor.patch\n(e.g., 1.3.5). It helps clients anticipate the impact of upgrades:\n\n * A major version signifies potentially breaking changes.\n * A minor version represents new but backward-compatible features.\n * A patch version involves bug fixes or minor enhancements with no impact on\n   compatibility.\n\n3. PROVIDE CLEAR VERSIONING DOCUMENTATION\n\n * API: Make versioning information readily available within the API\n   documentation.\n * Code: Help developers by clearly indicating how to manage versions in the\n   codebase.\n * Communicate: Keep users informed about version updates.\n\n4. GRADUALLY DECREMENT SUPPORT FOR OLD VERSIONS\n\n * Deprecation: Clearly mark older versions as deprecated to notify users of\n   imminent retirement.\n * Termination: Avoid supporting deprecated versions indefinitely. Provide a\n   clear timeline for phase-out.\n\n5. PRIORITIZE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY\n\nStrive to ensure that each new version continues to support existing\nintegrations. When a change becomes necessary, consider clean deprecations or\nalternative paths.\n\n6. AVOID QUERY PARAMETER VERSIONING\n\nWhile it might seem convenient, using query parameters can lead to caching\nissues and breaks with REST best practices.\n\n7. KEEP RESPONSE FORMATS CONSISTENT\n\nEnsure that the API delivers responses in the same structure, regardless of the\nversion. This consistency prevents client-side errors while parsing the data.\n\n\nRECOMMNEDATION\n\nThe most Futures are:\n\n * URI Based Versioning. It's straightforward and easy to understand for\n   developers. Although it can pollute URIs over time, this effect is often\n   negligible.","index":55,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"57.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU MAKE YOUR WEB API MORE RESTFUL?","answer":"REST stands for Representational State Transfer, a software architectural style\nthat establishes a set of constraints to build scalable and intuitive web\nservices.\n\nBy adhering to REST principles, developers can ensure both efficiency and\nsimplicity in their Web API design and functionality.\n\n\nKEY TENETS OF RESTFULNESS\n\n * Client-Server Architecture: This separation of concerns allows each to evolve\n   independently, with clients being unaware of server data storage.\n\n * Statelessness: Requests from the client must contain all necessary\n   information, ensuring the server can interpret and respond without relying on\n   past interactions.\n\n * Cacheability: Servers can enforce cache controls to help clients manage\n   resources more effectively.\n\n * Layered System: Clients interact with server resources and may not directly\n   access underlying services or data storage.\n\n * Uniform Interface: This key principle is elaborated on further:\n\n\nUNIFORM INTERFACE COMPONENTS\n\n * Identification of Resources: Assign each resource a unique URI, distinct from\n   the actions the API performs on it.\n\n * Manipulation of Resources Through Representations: Use standardized resource\n   representations like JSON, XML, or others, enabling a consistent interface\n   for resource manipulation.\n\n * Self-Descriptive Messages: Include all necessary information in the request\n   or response, reducing the need for additional out-of-band communication.\n\n * Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): Use hyperlinks to\n   represent the various state transitions a resource can undertake, allowing\n   the client to navigate through these states without needing prior knowledge.\n\n\nCOMMON REST AND NON-REST PARADIGMS\n\nRESTFUL APPROACHES\n\n * URI Pattern: Utilize nouns to define resources and HTTP method to specify the\n   action. For instance, GET /products/{id} retrieves a product by its ID.\n\n * HTTP Methods for Actions: Use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and\n   DELETE for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n\n * Response Status Codes: Employ HTTP status codes to communicate the outcome of\n   a request, such as 200 for a successful retrieval or 404 for a not found\n   resource.\n\n * Resource Relationships: Represent relationships between resources, such as\n   /users/{id}/orders.\n\n * Response Formatting: Return comprehensive data for user requests, minimizing\n   the need for multiple round-trips.\n\nNON-RESTFUL APPROACHES TO AVOID\n\n * Verbs in URI: Avoid using action verbs in URIs, like /getProduct.\n\n * Custom Actions over HTTP Methods: Direct actions, such as 'publish' or\n   'send-email,' should not be put through a simple GET request on a specific\n   URL. Instead, these custom actions should be treated as separate resources.\n\n * Misrepresenting Response Status Codes: Always use appropriate status codes;\n   for instance, using 200 for every response is counter to REST.\n\n * Lack of Resource Relationship: Don't structure URIs like\n   /getUserOrderInformation; the relationship between users and orders should be\n   encoded otherwise.\n\n * Overuse of Server-State for Data Management: REST APIs should strive for\n   statelessness, so avoid any reliance on server-side state for client\n   interactions.\n\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLES\n\nBAD PATTERN: NON-RESTFUL \"POLL INFORMATION\" URI\n\nGET /products/pollInformation/123\n\n\nGOOD PATTERN: RESTFUL \"RETRIEVE PRODUCT\" URI\n\nGET /products/{id}\n\n\nBAD PATTERN: INVALID HTTP METHOD\n\nGET /products/{id}/updateProduct\n\n\nGOOD PATTERN: PROPER HTTP METHOD FOR UPDATE\n\nPUT /products/{id}\n\n\nBAD PATTERN: RIGID RESPONSE CODES\n\nAlways returns 200\n\n\nGOOD PATTERN: APPROPRIATE RESPONSE CODES\n\n200 OK, 404 Not Found, 201 Created, etc.\n\n\nBAD PATTERN: INADEQUATE USE OF RESOURCE RELATIONSHIP\n\n/users/{id}/allOrders\n\n\nGOOD PATTERN: UTILIZING FULL RESOURCE RELATIONSHIP\n\nGET /users/{id}/orders\n","index":56,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"58.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON SECURITY ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF WHEN DEVELOPING A WEB API?","answer":"When developing a Web API, it's crucial to pay attention to security to\nsafeguard data and systems. Be wary of these common security concerns:\n\n\nCROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (CORS)\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) lets you define which domains can access\nyour API. This mechanism is pivotal in keeping the API accessible within\nintended platforms while thwarting unauthorized access.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nConfigure your API's HTTP response headers, using tools such as WebApi.Cors.\n\n\nINSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE (IDOR) AND ACCESS CONTROL\n\nIDOR relates to allowing a user to access resources directly instead of through\nproperly authorized methods. This opens doors to unauthorized access, where\nusers might tamper with payload data to view or modify objects meant for others.\n\nAccess Control issues can arise from insufficient validation and authorization\nchecks. Not ensuring that the calling user has the necessary privileges can lead\nto unwanted or unauthorized access.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nAdhere to proper authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT, and implement\nrobust authorization checks, potentially using a role-based system.\n\n\nXML EXTERNAL ENTITY (XXE) ATTACKS\n\nApplications using interfaces like REST can still be vulnerable to XXE attacks\nwhen trying to parse XML data without validation. An attacker can launch\nspecific payload attacks to read sensitive information from the server.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nRestrict XML parsing and, ideally, utilize JSON as the data interchange format\ninstead.\n\n\nINSECURE SSL/TLS MANAGEMENT\n\nFailing to implement SSL/TLS for securing sensitive data can result in\nunintended data exposure, such as in the form of plaintext credentials.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nIncorporate HTTPS and keep SSL/TLS libraries up to date. Use a reputable\ncertificate authority to validate the secure connection.\n\n\nRESOURCE EXHAUSTION\n\nWithout necessary rate limits on API calls, servers can suffer from sudden,\nexcessive traffic, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of\nService (DDoS) situations.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nImplement rate limiting to curtail the number of API requests from specific\nusers or sources.","index":57,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"97.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON PATTERNS USED IN API DEVELOPMENT?","answer":"I will now write an answer to the programming interview question on the ASP.NET\nWeb API.\n\n\nDESIGNING RESTFUL SERVICES IN WEB API\n\nREST, an architectural style for designing networked applications, is centered\naround the notion of stateless, uniform, resource-oriented interactions. Each\nresource is represented by a unique URI and supports various HTTP methods.\nActions on these resources are typically achieved through HTTP verbs, such as\nGET for retrieval and DELETE for removal.\n\n\nCOMMON REST API PATTERNS\n\nDIRECT HTTP METHOD MAPPING\n\nThe most straightforward approach, each method maps directly to the\ncorresponding HTTP operation. For instance, to obtain account details, you use a\nGET on the .../accounts/{id} endpoint.\n\nFILTER RESOURCES USING QUERY PARAMETERS\n\nIn scenarios where it's impractical to define a distinct endpoint for every\npossible filter combination, query strings are employed. For instance, a GET\nrequest to .../accounts?status=active retrieves all active accounts.\n\nNESTED RESOURCES\n\nUse nested resources for relationships making it clear which resource is the\nparent or child. For example, to fetch all orders related to a specific account,\nyou use a GET on .../accounts/{id}/orders.\n\nCUSTOM ACTIONS\n\nFor those situations that don't neatly fit into the standard REST operations,\nAPIs can define custom actions using HTTP methods like POST.

Here are some\nanti-patterns to be aware of:\n\n\nUNNECESSARILY COMPLEX ROUTING\n\nComplicated routing patterns can not only be confusing to the development team\nbut also pose as a security threat. If your routes are overly complex, it might\nbe harder for firewalls and other security measures to provide effective defense\nagainst exploits and attacks like \"Cross-Site Request Forgery\" and \"SQL\nInjection\".\n\n\nDIRECT DATABASE ACCESS FROM CONTROLLERS\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of good software design is the separation of\nconcerns. Controllers are the entry points to your application, and they should\nprimarily be responsible for request handling, not direct database operations.\n\nInstead, use a data access layer that allows for proper separation of concerns,\nmaking your application more testable, maintainable, and secure. For instance,\nyou can make use of ORMs like Entity Framework to facilitate this decoupling.\n\n\nDATA OVEREXPOSURE IN RESPONSES\n\nData privacy and application security should always be a top priority. Exposing\nthe entire database schema through APIs can be a serious oversight.\n\nDTOs (Data Transfer Objects) provide a solution. By selectively exposing\ndatabase fields through corresponding DTOs, you can ensure that only necessary\nand secure data is transmitted.\n\n\nIMPROPER USE OF HTTP METHODS\n\nThe HTTP protocol offers various methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., each\ndesigned for specific actions. However, sometimes these methods are used\ninappropriately, leading to an inconsistent and potentially insecure API.\n\nFor example, using a GET method to perform a deletion operation, or using a POST\nmethod for a read-only action could be problematic. Such misuse could trigger\nsecurity vulnerabilities and lead to unintended consequences.\n\n\nHEAVY RELIANCE ON QUERY STRINGS\n\nWhile query strings can be useful for smaller, optional parameters, a heavy\nreliance on them can lead to complex, error-prone routing and security issues.\nInstead, consider using REST principles, placing more emphasis on clear,\nhierarchical paths. Additionally, use HTTP headers, cookies, or request bodies\nfor sensitive or large data.\n\n\nUNCONTROLLED DATA SIZES\n\nDelivering excessively large datasets can lead to suboptimal application\nperformance and even contribute to security vulnerabilities. For instance, an\nunbounded request for all records in a huge dataset might cause a\ndenial-of-service scenario.\n\nIncorporate mechanisms such as result pagination to provide data in smaller,\ndiscrete chunks. Such controls can also be beneficial for mobile client\napplications with limited resources.\n\n\nMISMANAGEMENT OF CACHING\n\nWhile caching can be a powerful tool for enhancing API performance, it can just\nas easily become a point of failure if not managed carefully.\n\nMisconfigurations, such as failing to include proper cache headers in API\nresponses, can lead to outdated or inconsistent data in cache stores, giving\nclients erroneous information.\n\n\nINADEQUATE ERROR HANDLING\n\nProviding meaningful, consistent error messages to clients is essential for a\nconsistent and user-friendly API experience. Strive to furnish clear,\ninformative error responses rather than default server errors.\n\nEnsure that error messages aren't overly verbose or exposing sensitive data, as\nthis can lead to potential security issues.\n\nFor instance, OAuthFilter can be used to generalize error handling and return\nappropriate HTTP status codes, such as 401 Unauthorized. It provides a\nconsistent response format and helps hide sensitive information.\n\n\nUSING ORM MODELS DIRECTLY AS DTOS\n\nWhile the idea of using ORM models as DTOs might seem to simplify the data\ntransfer process, it can lead to inadvertent data exposure and doesn't align\nwith best practices pertaining to clean data separation.\n\nORM models inherently represent the structure of your data store, potentially\nexposing sensitive fields or attributes.

It\nprovides a set of methods to perform CRUD operations on the underlying data.\n\nThe key benefit of using the Repository Pattern with Web API is decoupling. Each\ncomponent can function independently, so changes in one don't necessitate\nmodifications in the other.\n\nSEPARATION OF CONCERNS\n\nThe Repository Pattern provides a clear separation of three primary layers:\n\n 1. Domain Logic: Business rules and data validation.\n 2. Data Source: Database or any persistence medium.\n 3. Repository: Interface between domain logic and data source.\n\nThis separation makes maintenance, testing, and updates simpler, as changes to\none layer don't broadly affect others.\n\nENCAPSULATION OF DATA QUERIES\n\nRepository definitions serve as a contract for accessing data. By abstracting\ndata access behind methods (such as GetById and GetAll), repositories control\nhow data is queried, securing against potential data inconsistencies.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\nLet's take a look at the C# code:\n\nDEFINE THE REPOSITORY INTERFACE\n\npublic interface IRepository<T>\n{\n    T GetById(int id);\n    IEnumerable<T> GetAll();\n    void Add(T entity);\n    void Update(T entity);\n    void Delete(int id);\n}\n\n\nIMPLEMENT THE REPOSITORY\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class UserRepository : IRepository<User>\n{\n    private List<User> users = new List<User>();\n    \n    public User GetById(int id)\n    {\n        return users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == id);\n    }\n\n    public IEnumerable<User> GetAll()\n    {\n        return users;\n    }\n\n    public void Add(User entity)\n    {\n        users.Add(entity);\n    }\n\n    public void Update(User entity)\n    {\n        var existingUser = GetById(entity.Id);\n        if (existingUser != null)\n        {\n            users.Remove(existingUser);\n            users.Add(entity);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Delete(int id)\n    {\n        var user = GetById(id);\n        if (user != null)\n        {\n            users.Remove(user);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nCONNECT WITH WEB API CONTROLLER\n\npublic class UserController : ApiController\n{\n    private IRepository<User> userRepository;\n\n    public UserController(IRepository<User> repository)\n    {\n        userRepository = repository;\n    }\n\n    // GET api/user\n    public IEnumerable<User> Get()\n    {\n        return userRepository.GetAll();\n    }\n\n    // POST api/user\n    public void Post([FromBody]User user)\n    {\n        userRepository.Add(user);\n    }\n\n    // PUT api/user/5\n    public void Put(int id, [FromBody]User user)\n    {\n        user.Id = id;\n        userRepository.Update(user);\n    }\n\n    // DELETE api/user/5\n    public void Delete(int id)\n    {\n        userRepository.Delete(id);\n    }\n}\n","index":64,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"63.\n\n\nWHAT IS WEB API OWIN MIDDLEWARE?","answer":"Web API OWIN Middleware allows you to configure your ASP.NET Web API application\nusing an OWIN-based application server. This middleware enables a decoupled\napproach to web application and server construction, providing greater\nflexibility and scalability.\n\nIt is through OWIN that hosting, such as IIS or self-hosted, and web\napplications are segmented. The middleware acts as the bridge between HTTP\nrequests and Web API, empowering you to plug in various requests handlers,\nauthentication methods, and data compression algorithms.\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF OWIN MIDDLEWARE\n\n 1. Web API Component: Serves as the central mechanism that processes and\n    responds to HTTP requests.\n\n 2. Middleware Component: Intercepts requests and pre-processes or\n    post-processes responses before they reach or leave the Web API component.\n\n 3. Applicant Builder: The function that wires up intercepting middleware\n    components and assembles them into a unified pipeline.\n\n 4. Request Environment: A dictionary-like structure that holds request-specific\n    and contextual data.\n\n 5. Generic Delegate Signature: Connects middleware components and allows them\n    to operate within the request pipeline.\n    \n    using AppFunc = Func<IDictionary<string, object>, Task>;\n    \n\n 6. Startup Configuration: Transparently configures the server before the Start\n    method (e.g., IAppBuilder's Configurationmethod).\n\n\nWORKING OF OWIN MIDDLEWARE IN WEB API\n\nWhen a client sends an HTTP request:\n\n 1. The OWIN server processes and prepares the request.\n 2. It passes the request to the OWIN pipeline, defined by the configured\n    middleware.\n 3. The request moves through each OWIN middleware component, potentially being\n    altered or enhanced.\n 4. Once the request passes through the entire pipeline, the server triggers an\n    HTTP response.\n\nThis modular and sequential behavior allows you to:\n\n * Examine and modify requests and responses with one or more middleware\n   components.\n * Orchestrate the control flow among different middleware components.\n * Customize server- and application-level behaviors.\n\nOPERATION FLOW IN WEB API OWIN MIDDLEWARE\n\nOperation Flow in Web API OWIN Middleware\n[https://mk0dotnetsurfijobx660.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/7712_021_04.png]\n\n\nKEY BENEFITS\n\n * Freedom from Hosting Limitations: With OWIN, applications are decoupled from\n   the hosting environment, giving you the liberty to transition between hosting\n   solutions without code alterations.\n\n * Middleware Segregation: Each OWIN-compatible component, such as Web API, is\n   autonomous, fostering cleaner application structuring and more transparent\n   functionality.\n\n * Extensibility and Reusability: Intermediate modules provide a boundary to\n   introduce custom functionality, which can be uniformly leveraged across\n   various components.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Concise Middleware Chains: To ensure swift request processing, moderate the\n   number of middleware components in a chain.\n * Asynchronous Task Use: Take advantage of asynchronous methods to maximize\n   performance and scalability.\n * Modular Functionality: Adhere to the single responsibility principle.

For instance, an HTTP POST request is matched to\n   an action with \"Post\" as the prefix.\n\n * Parameter Binding: Parameters in the query string, request body, and route\n   data are matched to parameters in the action method.\n\n * Content Negotiation: Based on the request's accept header, the framework\n   determines the type of data to send back to the client.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONAL ROUTING\n\n * RESTful Endpoints: With predefined naming conventions and HTTP method\n   correlation, Web API makes it straightforward to create adherent RESTful\n   endpoints.\n\n * Default Routes: Web API sets up default routes, so when a request doesn't\n   specify an action or a controller, conventions can take their place. This\n   feature is especially useful during early application development and when a\n   project has simpler routing requirements.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONVENTIONAL ROUTING IN WEB API\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// Define the Web API route\nconfig.Routes.MapHttpRoute(\n    name: \"DefaultApi\",\n    routeTemplate: \"api/{controller}/{id}\",\n    defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }\n);\n\n// An accompanying controller\npublic class UserController : ApiController\n{\n    // A GET request to /api/user/1 can bind to this action\n    public User Get(int id) { /* return user by id */ }\n\n    // A POST request to /api/user can bind to this action\n    public User Post([FromBody] User user) { /* create user and return */ }\n\n    // A PUT request to /api/user/1 can bind to this action\n    public User Put(int id, [FromBody] User user) { /* update user and return */ }\n\n    // A DELETE request to /api/user/1 can bind to this action\n    public void Delete(int id) { /* delete user by id */ }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, HTTP Verb methods in the controller are matched to the HTTP\naction methods by name. The id parameter is part of the route data and,\ntherefore, will be bound from the route in GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. In\nPOST requests, the id parameter can be bound from the route if it is present.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also use attribute routing for more fine-grained control\non a per-method or controller basis._ATTRIBUTE LIMITS:You may only have one\ndefault route in an application. Prefer attribute routing for scenarios where\nyou need multiple routes for one action or controller.\n\nIt is crucial to maintain a balance by integrating both attribute and\nconventional routing to benefit from the strengths of each approach.","index":70,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"69.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTION-BASED ROUTING AND HOW CAN THEY BE\nOVERCOME?","answer":"Convention-based routing in ASP.NET Web API is an approach that maps endpoints\nbased on conventions. While this can simplify configurations, it has\nlimitations.\n\n\nCOMMON LIMITATIONS\n\n * Flexibility: Convention-based routing might not cover some complex or\n   specific routing requirements.\n * Control: It can leave developers with limited control over the URL definition\n   and behavior.\n * Clarity: For team communication and cross-referencing, explicit routing\n   configurations can be more transparent.\n * Conflict Resolution: It can struggle in resolving conflicting or overlapping\n   route definitions.\n\n\nOVERCOMING LIMITATIONS WITH ATTRIBUTE ROUTING\n\nAttribute routing provides a more granular, explicit, and focused approach to\ndefining routes, collaborating well with conventional route setups.\n\n 1. Mixed Routing Styles: Seamlessly combine attribute and convention-based\n    routing. This affords the flexibility and fine control of attribute routing\n    alongside the convenience of convention-based routing where possible.\n\n 2. Immediate Attribute Application: Attributes are quick to comprehend, and\n    their immediate application to methods and controllers makes associating\n    endpoints with actions direct and clear.\n\n 3. Route Debugging: Using attributes often simplifies route troubleshooting\n    because the route definition is localized within the associated controller\n    or method. In contrast, debugging conventional routes can be more complex.\n\n 4. Advanced Constraints: Attributes present a more intuitive way to set\n    advanced route constraints. This can include specifying custom requirements\n    using RegularExpression or implementing constraints via the\n    IHttpRouteConstraint interface.\n\n 5. Global Route Application: Framework versions 2.1 and later offer the\n    flexibility to define a default route template and other global defaults.\n    This allows widespread route definitions throughout the application.\n\n 6.

However, these techniques come with unique benefits and potential\npitfalls, notably in the context of writing asynchronous controllers in Web API.\n\n\nKEY REASONS FOR ASYNCHRONY IN WEB API\n\nUsing asynchronous operations in Web API provides several advantages:\n\n * Improved Responsiveness: Asynchronous operations help in keeping the server\n   responsive, especially when handling I/O-bound tasks like network or database\n   calls.\n * Enhanced Scalability: Asynchronous controllers better utilize server\n   resources. They enable the server to handle more requests concurrently by\n   freeing up threads that would otherwise be blocked.\n * Optimal Use of I/O: Asynchronous code can provide better performance for\n   I/O-bound tasks because it doesn't keep a thread blocked.\n\n\nRISKS AND BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Complex Error Handling: Asynchronous code can make error handling more\n   complex. It's essential to have robust mechanisms to capture and handle\n   exceptions across asynchronous operations.\n * Inconsistent State: The asynchronous nature can lead to potential state\n   mismatches, which can be tricky to manage in web environments. It's crucial\n   to be mindful of request/response lifecycles.\n * Performance Overhead for Simple Code: Although asynchronous code might be\n   more efficient for I/O-bound tasks, there can be an overhead for simple,\n   quick operations. The decision should be based on the context of the task.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR DEVELOPING ASYNCHRONOUS CONTROLLERS\n\n 1. Concise Contexts: Leverage asynchronous operations for tasks that genuinely\n    benefit from them, such as I/O-bound activities.\n 2. Synchronized Execution for Data Consistency: Ensure synchronized execution\n    of correlated tasks to maintain data consistency, even if they are being\n    executed asynchronously.\n 3. Task Coordination to Prevent \"Fire-and-Forget\": Use mechanisms like\n    Task.Wait or await to track tasks' completion, preventing them from running\n    independently and leading to missed errors or resource leaks.\n 4. End-to-End Asynchronous Flows: Strive for an end-to-end asynchronous flow to\n    maintain the benefits throughout the request's lifecycle.\n 5. Statelessness and Thread-Safety: Favor stateless components and structures\n    to ease management of shared data, adhering to principles like\n    thread-safety.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SYNCHRONOUS VS. ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n 1. Synchronous: A simple endpoint that retrieves data from a database\n    synchronously:\n    \n    public IHttpActionResult GetData()\n    {\n        var data = _dataRepository.GetData();\n        return Ok(data);\n    }\n    \n\n 2.

CONTROLLER-LEVEL FORMATTERS\n\nIt's crucial to note that Web API allows configuring formatters at the global\nand controller or action levels.\n\nWhile global configurations are defined in WebApiConfig.cs and apply to all\ncontrollers and actions in the application, Controller or action-level\nconfigurations can override the global settings.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONTROLLER-LEVEL FORMATTERS\n\nYou can tweak formatters in a specific controller:\n\n[RoutePrefix(\"api/customers\")]\npublic class CustomerController : ApiController\n{\n    public HttpResponseMessage Get(int id, HttpRequestMessage request)\n    {\n        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, new Customer());  \n        response.Content.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue(\"application/json\");\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n\n\nBy manually setting the content type as JSON in the action or controller, you\ncan ensure a specific return content type.\n\n\nMIME TYPES\n\nWhile MIME types such as application/xml and application/json are the most\ncommon, Web API can handle custom MIME types as well.\n\nYou can define a custom formatter to handle new MIME types or extend the\nexisting ones.

Setting Claim Types in Web API Token Configurations\n\nTo configure the types and roles in Web API, you can use the following code:\n\n\napp.UseOAuthAuthorizationServer(new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions {\n    AllowInsecureHttp = false,\n    AuthorizeEndpointPath = new PathString(\"/authorize\"),\n    TokenEndpointPath = new PathString(\"/token\"),\n    AccessTokenExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),\n    Provider = new CustomOAuthProvider(),\n    AccessTokenFormat = new CustomJwtFormat(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"jwtIssuer\"])\n});\n\npublic void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)\n{\n    app.UseOAuthBearerTokens(OAuthOptions);\n    app.UseOAuthAuthorizationServer(OAuthServerOptions);\n}\n\n\n 2. Generating Tokens with Claims\n\nThis is a metadata LUIS that needs details.\n\n 3. Processing Tokens on the Web API Side\n\nAfter receiving tokens, the Web API needs to verify the token's authenticity and\nthen unpack and read their claims.\n\n * Attributing Controllers for Authorization\n\nIn the Web API controllers, you can use attributes like [Authorize] to restrict\naccess based on token-claims.\n\nHere's an example of a controller that only allows access to users with the\n\"Admin\" role:\n\n[Authorize(Roles = \"Admin\")]\npublic class AdminController : ApiController\n{\n  // Actions for admin users\n}\n\n\n * Handling Claims within Code\n   \n   The Controller is a text-based tool that will take sentences as input and\n   output instructions. It won't handle claims directly.\n\nIn your controllers' actions, you can call User property to get the current user\nand fetch their claims.\n\nHere's an example that uses User.IsInRole to check if a user has the opinion to\nthe \"Teacher\" role:\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic IHttpActionResult GetTeachers()\n{\n    if (!User.IsInRole(\"Teacher\"))\n    {\n        throw new HttpResponseException(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);\n    }\n\n    // Fetch your teachers listing\n}\n\n\n 4. Consuming Tokens from Client Applications\n\n * Sending Tokens in Requests: Clients must send their OAuth tokens in the\n   Authorization header to be authenticated.\n * Handling Authorized vs Unauthorized Responses: Clients need to handle\n   different response codes, such as 401 for unauthorized access.\n\nvar client = new HttpClient();\nclient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", token);\nvar response = await client.GetAsync(\"https://yourapi.com/api/teachers\");\n\nif (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\n{\n    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n    // Process response\n}\nelse if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)\n{\n    // Handle unauthorized access\n}\n","index":82,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"81.\n\n\nEXPLAIN CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) PROTECTION IN WEB API.","answer":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a malicious attack where a user is tricked\ninto executing unwanted actions on a web application.

If the token is missing or invalid, the server will return a 400 Bad\nRequest response.","index":84,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"83.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT CACHING MECHANISMS AVAILABLE TO A WEB API?","answer":"ASP.NET Web API supports both server-side and client-side caching to streamline\nperformance and data consistency.\n\n\nWEB API CACHING MECHANISMS\n\nOUTPUT CACHE (SERVER-SIDE)\n\n * Description: Stores generated HTTP responses.\n * Storage: In-memory (default) or with distributed caching solutions.\n * Attribution Method: Decorators: [OutputCache] and [Route].\n * Customization: Time-based expiration, rich control over cache parameters.\n\nIN-MEMORY CACHE\n\n * Description: Temporary, in-process data storage.\n * Storage: Server's RAM.\n * Attribution Method: None.\n * Customization: Direct code integration for caching.\n\nDISTRIBUTED CACHE (SERVER-SIDE)\n\n * Description: Shared cache across web servers or a separate caching server.\n * Storage: Common cache server, e.g., Redis.\n * Attribution Method: None or requires code for integration.\n * Customization: Configurable expiration, automatic consistency across servers.\n\nHTTP CACHING (CLIENT-SIDE)\n\n * Description: Leverages HTTP headers (Cache-Control and ETag) for caching.\n * Storage: Browser or client application.\n * Attribution Method: Controllers and response headers.\n * Customization: Cache-control directives, ETag management, e.g., using version\n   numbers or timestamps.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SERVER-SIDE CACHING\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nWeb.config Setup:\n\n<caching>\n  <outputCacheSettings>\n    <outputCacheProfiles>\n      <apiCache duration=\"3600\" location=\"Any\" noStore=\"false\" />\n    </outputCacheProfiles>\n  </outputCacheSettings>\n</caching>\n\n\nAPI Method for Output Cache:\n\n[HttpGet]\n[OutputCache(CacheProfile = \"apiCache\")]\npublic IHttpActionResult GetCachedData()\n{\n    // Code to fetch or generate data\n    return Ok(data);\n}\n\n\nAPI Method for In-Memory Cache:\n\nprivate static readonly MemoryCache Cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic string GetFromMemoryCache(string key)\n{\n    if (Cache.TryGetValue(key, out string value))\n    {\n        return value;\n    }\n    \n    // Code to fetch or generate data\n    // Cache.Set(key, value, new MemoryCacheEntryOptions().SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60)));\n\n    return value;\n}\n\n\nAPI Method for Distributed Cache (Redis):\n\nprivate readonly IDistributedCache _cache;\n\npublic MyController(IDistributedCache cache)\n{\n    _cache = cache;\n}\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic string GetFromDistributedCache(string key)\n{\n    string value = _cache.GetString(key);\n    if (value != null)\n    {\n        return value;\n    }\n    \n    // Code to fetch or generate data\n    // _cache.SetString(key, value, new DistributedCacheEntryOptions().SetAbsoluteExpiration(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(1)));\n    \n    return value;\n}\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CLIENT-SIDE CACHING\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nController Method for HTTP Caching:\n\n[HttpGet]\n[ResponseCache(Duration = 3600)]\npublic IActionResult GetCachedData()\n{\n    // Code to fetch or generate data\n    return Ok(data);\n}\n\n\nGenerating and Validating an ETag:\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic IActionResult GetWithETag()\n{\n    var data = // fetch data;\n    var etag = CalculateETag(data);\n    \n    if (Request.Headers.ContainsKey(\"If-None-Match\") && Request.Headers[\"If-None-Match\"] == etag)\n    {\n        return StatusCode(304); // Not Modified\n    }\n\n    return Ok(data);\n}\n\n\nETag Calculation:\n\nprivate string CalculateETag(object data)\n{\n    using (var sha = new SHA1Managed())\n    {\n        var hash = sha.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(data)));\n        return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);\n    }\n}\n","index":85,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"84.\n\n\nHOW DOES SERVER-SIDE CACHING WORK IN WEB API?","answer":"Server-side caching within Web API speeds up client requests by storing and\nreusing frequently-accessed data on the server.\n\n\nHOW SERVER-SIDE CACHING WORKS IN WEB API\n\nWhen you generate content, you can indicate that it is cacheable by setting\ncaching response headers, like Cache-Control or Expires.\n\nWeb API matches subsequent requests with these headers, automatically serving up\nthe cached copy, if still valid.

It aids in modifying, short-circuiting, or\nanalyzing HTTP requests and responses. These modular units can range from\nsimple-to-complex, catering to various requisites.\n\n\nMIDDLEWARE COMPONENTS\n\n 1. GlobalExceptionFilter: A centralized error handler to capture unhandled\n    exceptions generated from various parts of the application.\n\n 2. HTTP Message Handlers (DelegatingHandler): Operate on both incoming requests\n    and outgoing responses. These can also be ganarilized for loging, request\n    authentication, and other operations.\n\n 3. Operation Constraints: Use these to ensure that specific operations under\n    defined constraints.\n\n 4. Request Actions: These Prompt actions like request-response or request\n    abandonment.\n\n 5. Response Writers: These are for common message formats or document\n    generation and can contain custom formats.\n\n 6. Authorization: Execute user access validations on the requests.\n\n\nTHE WEB API PIPELINE AND MIDDLEWARE SEQUENCE\n\n 1. HTTP Request: It is intercepted by the middleware components, specifically\n    HTTP Message Handlers and global exception filters.

Routing: During the action selection phase, constraints can influence the\n    routing mechanism, leading to immediate request termination or filtering\n    off-specific actions.\n\n 3. Action Execution: After the action context is suitably forged, Web API\n    transitions to its core, invoking designated actions.\n\n 4.

It's based on the idea that a RESTful API response should not only\ninclude the resource representation but also provide links to related resources,\nguiding the client's next possible actions. This approach fosters a more\nself-descriptive and discoverable API.\n\n\nTHE FIELD OF HYPERMEDIA\n\nHypermedia refers to the technique of embedding hyperlinks within resources,\nlike what's commonly seen on web pages. HATEOAS applies this concept to REST\nAPIs.\n\nUNIFIED INTERFACE\n\nHATEOAS ensures that all RESTful resources present a consistent interface. The\nclient navigates through the actions based on the contextual links provided,\nwithout needing prior knowledge about the API structure.\n\nFor instance, if a client fetches a list of products from a RESTful e-commerce\nAPI, the response may include links for purchasing, adding to a shopping cart,\nor even discovering related products.\n\nClient code is thus decoupled from the API's concrete resource and URI\nstructure, promoting more maintainable and evolvable systems.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF HATEOAS\n\nENHANCED DISCOVERABILITY\n\nHATEOAS makes it easier for new developers to explore an API by showing the\navailable next steps. This convenience is especially advantageous for public or\nopen APIs, contributing to faster adoptions and reduced learning curves.\n\nDYNAMIC BEHAVIOR\n\nIt enables dynamic behavior based on the server's state and responses rather\nthan predefined, rigid client-server interactions.

It\nwas widely used before the introduction of CORS in modern browsers.\n\n\nWHY JSONP WAS POPULAR\n\nPrior to the widespread adoption of CORS, web applications were often\nconstrained by the same-origin policy, which restricts how a web page is allowed\nto request resources from other origins. JSONP offered a way to bypass these\nlimitations.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n 1. Request: A client (originating from a different domain or protocol) makes a\n    JSONP request by loading a script from the server.\n\n 2. Server Response: The server wraps the JSON data in a function call supplied\n    by the client as a query parameter in the URL. This response is executed as\n    a script.\n\n 3. Execution: The response, now a script, is executed by the client, thereby\n    indirectly calling the provided client-supplied callback function with the\n    JSON data.\n\n\nWEB API INTEGRATION\n\nWhile ASP.NET Web API does not natively support JSONP out-of-the-box, you can\ninclude this functionality with a custom DelegatingHandler.\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Web;\n\npublic class JsonpHandler : DelegatingHandler\n{\n    protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n    {\n        var query = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(request.RequestUri.Query);\n        var callback = query[\"callback\"];\n\n        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(callback))\n        {\n            return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>\n            {\n                var resp = new HttpResponseMessage();\n                resp.Content = new StringContent(string.Format(\"{0}({1});\", callback, resp.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result));\n                return resp;\n            });\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nHere is how you can register the handler in your WebApiConfig.cs:\n\nconfig.MessageHandlers.Add(new JsonpHandler());\n\n\nOnce the JsonpHandler is registered, clients can utilize JSONP by specifying a\ncallback query parameter in their GET requests. When this parameter is present,\nthe handler wraps the response in a function call using the callback name.\n\nFor example:\n\nGET /api/products?callback=myFunction\n\n\nIn this example, the server should respond with a script that looks like this:\n\nmyFunction({...});\n","index":98,"topic":" ASP.NET Web API ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"100.\n\n\nHOW CAN ASP.NET WEB API LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DOCKER AND KUBERNETES?","answer":"ASP.NET Web API works synergistically with Docker and Kubernetes to optimize\ndeployment, management, and scalability of web applications.\n\n\nCONTAINERIZATION FOR WEB API\n\nDocker streamlines application lifecycle management within containers.
