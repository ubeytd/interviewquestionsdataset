It's a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that offers a\nrange of features, including querying, change tracking, and more.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Context: Acts as a gatekeeper between your application and the database. It\n   represents a session and holds an object cache.\n * Entity: A plain-old CLR object (POCO), reflective of a database table or\n   view.\n * Storage Model: Represents the database schema, including tables,\n   relationships, and views.\n * Mapping: Establishes the relationships between entities and the storage\n   model.\n\n\n3 FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS\n\n * Model: Describes the entities, their properties, and relationships. The model\n   is defined using Code-First, Database-First, or Model-First approaches. EF\n   can also infer the model from an existing database.\n\n * Database: Represents the storage where the entity data is persisted.\n\n * Data Services: Provide mechanisms to query and perform CRUD (Create, Read,\n   Update, Delete) operations on entities in the database.\n\n\nEF ARCHITECTURE STYLES\n\nCODE-FIRST\n\n * Development Approach: Begins with the definition of your model classes and\n   relationships, and EF generates the database schema accordingly.\n * Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where you have an existing database but want to\n   develop and maintain the database schema using C# or VB.NET.\n\nDATABASE-FIRST\n\n * Development Approach: Involves designing the database schema first and then\n   creating the EF model based on the schema.\n * Use Case: Suited when you need to work with an existing database and want to\n   generate the model classes based on that database.\n\nMODEL-FIRST\n\n * Development Approach: Implement the model graphically via the EF designer or\n   XML-based EDMX file, and then generate the database schema and model classes.\n * Use Case: Typically used in legacy applications or for rapid application\n   development where the model is defined first and is then used to generate the\n   database schema and classes.\n\nHYBRID APPROACHES\n\nIn many real-world applications, the clear distinction between the development\napproaches might not always hold true.

It supports visual designers and can generate code from databases and\n   vice-versa.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: While also developed by Microsoft, it's more lightweight\n   compared to EF. It's specifically designed for modeling databases using\n   objects, methods, and LINQ.\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP CAPABILITIES\n\n * Entity Framework: It offers better support for complex relationships,\n   including many-to-many relationships.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: It supports basic relationships, but isn't as robust in managing\n   complex ones.\n\n\nCODE AND DATABASE SYNCHRONIZATION\n\n * Entity Framework: It features database-first, code-first, and model-first\n   approaches. It can synchronize the code with the database schema.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: It's primarily a database-first approach. Changes to the\n   database must be reflected in the code manually.\n\n\nSCHEMA EVOLUTION\n\n * Entity Framework: It supports automatic database migration through code-first\n   approaches, making it convenient for evolving schemas.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: It requires manual updates to the model, and these changes need\n   to be explicitly propagated to the database. It does not support automatic\n   migration.\n\n\nQUERYING CAPABILITIES\n\n * Entity Framework: Its querying capabilities are broader due to its ability to\n   work with objects outside the database context, like in-memory datasets.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: With a focus on the database, it's optimized for translating\n   LINQ queries directly to SQL, but it's not as versatile as EF.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE AND OVERHEAD\n\n * Entity Framework: With its superior feature set, it can introduce more\n   overhead, especially in complex scenarios.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: As a more focused and lighter framework, it can sometimes\n   provide better performance in specific use cases.\n\n\nDATA INTEGRITY AND TRANSACTIONS\n\n * Entity Framework: It offers better data integrity management and\n   transactional support due to its broader feature set.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: It's not as robust in managing transactions and data integrity.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION AND FINE-TUNING\n\n * Entity Framework: Given its feature-rich nature, it offers more options for\n   fine-tuning, especially relating to caching, data loading mechanism, etc.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: While potentially providing better performance in simpler\n   scenarios, it offers limited options for fine-tuning and optimization.\n\n\nSUITABLE USE CASES\n\n * Entity Framework: It's a comprehensive ORM framework suited for complex\n   enterprise systems, multi-tiered applications, or applications where the\n   database schema evolves frequently.\n\n * LINQ to SQL: Due to its lightweight nature, it's better suited for simple\n   applications or those where extensive ORM features aren't required.","index":2,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nWHAT IS DBCONTEXT AND HOW IS IT USED IN EF?","answer":"DbContext, a key part of Entity Framework, functions as an intelligent bridge\nbetween the application and the database.

Entity Tracking: DbSet monitors changes made to the entities during their\n    lifespan. Modifications are categorized as Added, Deleted, or Updated, based\n    on which Entity Framework controls how the changes are reflected in the\n    database.\n\n 2. LINQ Queries: You can harness the power of Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)\n    to extract, manipulate, and in some cases, construct new model entities from\n    database tables. DbSet acts as a LINQ query provider.\n\n 3. CRUD Operations: DbSet provides straightforward methods to: insert new\n    entities (Add), update their values (Update), remove them (Remove), retrieve\n    entities by their primary key (Find), and also execute bulk operations such\n    as deleting all entities from the table in memory (RemoveRange).\n\n 4. Data Binding: It offers data binding capabilities, making it easier to\n    integrate entities seamlessly with UI components in supported platforms like\n    WPF and WinForms. This ensures that changes in UI maps back to the entities\n    and vice versa, and these changes are tracked effortlessly by the DbSet.\n    This aids in handling more extensive workflows with many entities and\n    updates. However, Data Binding is not supported in the most recent versions\n    of Entity Framework Core.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WORKING WITH DBSET\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class MyDbContext : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic static void Main()\n{\n    using (var context = new MyDbContext())\n    {\n        // Retrieve an employee by their unique identifier\n        var employee = context.Employees.Find(1);\n\n        // Update the title of the employee\n        employee.Title = \"Senior Engineer\";\n\n        // Mark the entity as Modified\n        context.Employees.Update(employee);\n\n        // Save changes to the database\n        context.SaveChanges();\n\n        // Delete an employee\n        var employeeToDelete = context.Employees.Find(2);\n        context.Employees.Remove(employeeToDelete);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n\n        // Query for a specific set of employees\n        var engineeringEmployees = context.Employees.Where(e => e.Department == \"Engineering\").ToList();\n    }\n}\n","index":4,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nCAN YOU DESCRIBE THE CONCEPT OF MIGRATIONS IN EF?","answer":"Entity Framework (EF) Migrations streamline the management of database schema\nchanges, offering an automated approach to keep the schema in sync with your\nmodel.\n\n\nWHY USE MIGRATIONS\n\n * Schema Evolution: Migrations facilitate seamless updates to the database\n   schema as the underlying model evolves.\n\n * Collaboration: By keeping schema changes as code, the entire development team\n   can track, review, and apply them using source control management.\n\n * Automation: Migrating databases can be a near-automated task in environments\n   such as build pipelines or during application upgrades.\n\n * Reproducibility: With each schema change being versioned, rollback and\n   forward/backward compatibility becomes clearer and more manageable.\n\n * Multistep Migrations: Complicated updates that involve several smaller\n   changes can be broken down into sequential migrations, ensuring that at each\n   intermediate step, the database remains in a consistent state.\n\n * Code Paradigm: Developers can remain in the code-first perspective, designing\n   models and letting EF take care of the database details.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n * Migration: A script or set of instructions that transforms the database from\n   one state to another.\n\n * Migration History Table: A system table in the database that stores the\n   chronology of applied migrations. This allows EF to determine the current\n   state of the database and what migrations, if any, are pending.\n\n * Migration Configuration: Migrations can be tuned and customized through a\n   dedicated configuration class.\n\n * Model Snapshot: Migrations are backed by a \"snapshot\" of the model at each\n   evolutionary stage, enabling EF to compare the existing database with the\n   model and generate required scripts.\n\n\nTHE WORKFLOW\n\nEntity Framework organizes the migration workflow into distinct steps:\n\n 1. Create Initial Migration: This step is about establishing the starting\n    point—creating a migration that encompasses the existing model.\n\n 2. Code and Model Changes: Whenever you make changes to your code-first model,\n    you sync these changes using Migrations. This typically involves a few\n    commands provided by your development environment, such as add-migration in\n    Visual Studio or dotnet ef migrations add via the .NET CLI.\n\n 3. Database Update: Once the migration script is generated, you apply the\n    changes to the database. This is done using update-database in Visual\n    Studio, dotnet ef database update in the .NET CLI, or programmatically in\n    your code.\n    \n    For example, in C#, you would call Context.Database.Migrate() during the\n    database initialization process.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Consistent Naming: Maintain a unified and meaningful naming convention for\n   your migrations to ensure clarity, especially in team settings.\n\n * Continuous Migration: Invest in a reflexive approach where, as part of the\n   development pipeline, databases are continuously and seamlessly updated.\n\n * Source Control: Migrations are essentially code that should be tracked,\n   versioned, and deployed along with your application code.\n\n * Validation: Before applying a migration, consider running automated tests to\n   ensure systemic stability.\n\n * Periodic Cleanup: Over time, your project may accumulate numerous migrations.\n   Consolidate or remove obsolete ones to keep the codebase manageable.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DATA ANNOTATIONS FOR MIGRATIONS\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class Customer\n{\n    [Key] // Identifies the primary key of the entity.\n    public int CustomerId { get; set; }\n    \n    [Required] // Specifies that a value is required for the property.\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n","index":5,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nHOW DOES EF IMPLEMENT CODE-FIRST, DATABASE-FIRST, AND MODEL-FIRST APPROACHES?","answer":"Let's explore how Entity Framework (EF) implements three primary design\nmethodologies: Code-First, Database-First, and Model-First.\n\n\nDATABASE-FIRST\n\nIn a Database-First approach, the data model initially resides in an existing\ndatabase. EF then generates the corresponding model and code.\n\nPROCESS STEPS\n\n 1. Generate Object Context: Tools such as Entity Framework Designer in Visual\n    Studio or CLI-based ef commands build an Object Context derived from the\n    database schema. This context forms a bridge between database entities and\n    the application's domain model.\n\n 2. Create Entity Classes: EF creates entity classes corresponding to database\n    tables, along with necessary properties and relationships. These classes map\n    closely to the existing schema.\n\n 3. Compile and Use: Developers integrate the generated classes with their\n    applications and invoke the database via these entities.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Quick adaptability to existing databases for legacy systems or applications\n   with strict schema requirements.\n * Automatic code generation streamlines the development process.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\n * Extra Work for Complex Changes: Efficiently handling complex updates to the\n   database structure can be challenging.\n\n\nCODE-FIRST\n\nIn a Code-First approach, developers define the data model using accessible\nclasses. This model acts as the primary resource for schema creation and\ndatabase persistence.\n\nPROCESS STEPS\n\n 1. Write POCO Classes: Developers craft plain, POCO (Plain Old CLR Object)\n    classes representing the business entities of the application. Annotations\n    or a Fluent API configuration guide EF in understanding how these classes\n    map to the database.\n\n 2. Create Data Context: A context class, derived from DbContext, serves as an\n    access point to the database and a tracker for entity changes.\n\n 3. Refine Model as Necessary: Refinement of the model is consistent with the\n    application's evolving requirements. Migrations, for instance, allow for the\n    sequential remodeling of the database.\n\n 4. Database Generation/Application Launch: The database schema is either\n    generated or updated when the application runs. This can be achieved using\n    migrations or by explicitly invoking the database initialize method in code.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Flexible Model Evolution: The data model adapts directly to the evolving\n   needs of the application.\n * Coherent Code and Database Schema Maintenance: Simplified schema management\n   from the codebase, supporting version control and collaborative development.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\n * Potential Synchronization Issues: Developers must ensure that the\n   application's classes and the underlying database schema stay aligned.\n\n\nMODEL-FIRST\n\nIn the Model-First approach, developers define the conceptual model using a\ndesigner tool. This high-level model is refined, and database schema and code\nare then generated accordingly.\n\nPROCESS STEPS\n\n 1. Design Conceptual Model: An EF Designer or Model Builder tool such as Visual\n    Studio's Entity Data Model Designer is used to define a conceptual model.\n    This encompasses entities, relationships, and other data-related features.\n\n 2. Generate Database from EF Model: After establishing the conceptual model,\n    configuration tools in Visual Studio or Entity Data Model Wizard generate\n    the underlying database schema.\n\n 3. Code Generation: EF also facilitates the automatic creation of classes that\n    mirror the model, using tools like T4 Templates or designers.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Visual Modeling First: Offers an intuitive approach for initial model\n   creation, often beneficial for understanding business requirements.\n * Unified Development Environment: Developers can manage the complete process,\n   from model design to code generation, within a single tool such as Visual\n   Studio.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nModel-Code Mismatch Potential: Designs may not perfectly match generated code,\nand manual code changes can impact future model-based code generation.\n\nThe Database-First approach is particularly helpful for legacy databases and was\nwidely used in earlier EF versions. In contrast, Code-First has become a\npreferred choice for new projects due to its better control over data models and\nsupport for model evolution through features like Migrations. Visual Studio's\ndesigner is suitable for projects that require rapid visualization, but its use\nis limited in continuous integration and delivery scenarios.","index":6,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE EDMGEN TOOL IN EF?","answer":"The _EdmGen tool plays a vital role in Entity Framework, especially during\ndesign and build phases.\n\n\nWHAT IS _EDMGEN_?\n\nThe EdmGen tool is a command-line utility that comes with Entity Framework.

Entity Type: Represents an object or data, such as a person or product. An\n     entity type corresponds to a table in a database.\n     \n     Example:\n     \n     public class Product\n     {\n         public int ProductID { get; set; }\n         public string Name { get; set; }\n         public decimal Price { get; set; }\n     }\n     \n\n 2.  Entity Set: This is a collection or group of entity instances of a specific\n     entity type. Internally, they map to tables in the database.\n     \n     Example:\n     \n     public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }\n     \n\n 3.  Association: Specifies the relationship between two or more entity types.\n     For instance, in a one-to-many relationship between Order and Product, an\n     Order can have multiple Products.\n     \n     Example:\n     \n     public class Order\n     {\n         [Key]\n         public int OrderID { get; set; }\n         public ICollection<Product> Products { get; set; }\n     }\n     \n\n 4.  Complex Type: Represents an object with a composite state, possibly\n     comprising various related entities. It doesn't have a key attribute and\n     cannot exist independently.\n     \n     Example:\n     \n     [ComplexType]\n     public class Address\n     {\n         public string Street { get; set; }\n         public string City { get; set; }\n         public string ZipCode { get; set; }\n     }\n     \n\n 5.  Association Set: This corresponds to a group of related entities. It's\n     primarily used for tracking relationships in the database.\n\n 6.  Function Import: Maps stored procedures or user-defined functions in the\n     database to corresponding methods in the context.\n\n 7.  Scalar Property: Represents simple, individual properties of an entity\n     type.\n\n 8.  Navigation Property: Enables navigation from one end of an association to\n     another.\n\n 9.  Entity Container: This acts as a container for all the objects used within\n     the model, like entity types, complex types, and entity sets.\n\n 10. Inheritance: Allows for object-oriented concepts such as inheritance and\n     polymorphism in the model. You can define base and derived entity types.\n     When you create a hierarchy, EF organizes the entities in a database table\n     to mirror this relationship.\n\n 11. Child Entity Type: When using the TPH strategy, child types come into play.\n     They represent types that inherit from a parent entity type and exist in a\n     TPH configuration.\n\n\nDATABASE-FIRST DESIGN\n\nThe EDM provides for Database-First design, where the EDM and entities are\ngenerated from an existing database schema. This method offers a parallel\nadvantage where when the database schema undergoes changes, the modifications\nare mirrored in the model.\n\n\nCODE-FIRST APPROACH\n\nWith the Code-First approach, which is commonly known and preferred by\ndevelopers because of the flexibility and ease of sharing with the teams, the\nEDM is derived from the code representation of the data model. Developers write\nclasses to represent the model and establish relationships within them, and EF\ngenerates the database based on these classes.\n\n\nMODEL-FIRST STRATEGY\n\nThe Model-First strategy allows developers to create the EDM graphically using\ndesigner tools such as Visual Studio's EDM Designer. This method is especially\nfavored where intricate models are in play.\n\nWhat's noteworthy is EDM's capability to cater to multiple storage schemas.\nWhether the source is a relevant database, an XML document, or various data\nsources, EDM is versatile and adaptable.","index":8,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"10.\n\n\nHOW DOES LAZY LOADING WORK IN EF?","answer":"Lazy loading allows related objects to be fetched from the database only when\nthey are accessed. This reduces the initial data load, making the system more\nefficient.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Proxy Generation: When a navigation property is virtual, Entity Framework\n   generates a dynamic proxy at runtime.\n\n * Interception Mechanism: Access to the navigation property triggers a database\n   query through a proxy instance. The process is monitored by EF to maintain\n   data consistency.\n\n * Underlying Context Connection: The context maintains a virtual link to\n   related entities.

Collection Navigation Property: Corresponds to a one-to-many or many-to-many\n    relationship and holds a list of entities.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ONE-TO-MANY\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class Course {\n    public int CourseId { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Student {\n    public int StudentId { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Course Course { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nIn the above example:\n\n * The Course class uses a Collection Navigation Property called Students\n   representing \"One Course has many Students\".\n * The Student class has a Single Navigation Property called Course representing\n   \"One Student belongs to one Course\".\n\n\nBENEFITS OF NAVIGATION PROPERTIES\n\n 1. Querying Made Easier: They eliminate the need for complex JOIN operations in\n    SQL, making code more readable and maintainable.\n\n 2. Cascade Actions: The related entities can also be modified or deleted if a\n    navigation property is defined with cascade actions. This simplifies data\n    management.\n\n 3. Efficient Lazy Loading: Entity Framework loads related entities only when\n    needed. This prevents unnecessary database hits.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR USING NAVIGATION PROPERTIES\n\n * Use Explicit Data Annotations: If you want more control over how things are\n   named and organized in the database and your model, use data annotations or\n   the Fluent API.\n\n * Avoid Mixing Data and Presentation Concerns: Don't expose domain logic\n   through navigation properties. Keep them focused on providing relationships\n   within the domain.\n\n * Avoid Circular References: Be cautious about circular references between\n   navigation properties. It can lead to unintended data fetches and potential\n   infinite loops in serialization, especially when working with web services or\n   APIs.","index":22,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"24.\n\n\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN ENTITY FRAMEWORK'S FLUENT API?","answer":"The Fluent API in Entity Framework provides a programmatic way to define the\nmodel configuration in your domain model classes.

It\n   ensures that no records are inadvertently overwritten by another user without\n   their intended changes being considered.\n\n * Pessimistic Concurrency: EF supports optimistic concurrency. While\n   pessimistic concurrency can be implemented using database transactions and\n   locks, EF doesn't provide explicit in-built support for this.\n\n\nTYPES OF CONCURRENCY CONFLICTS\n\n * Timestamp-based Checks (also known as \"Row Versioning\"): Detects conflicts\n   based on the last update time or version of a record. This technique\n   typically uses a timestamp column, which automatically updates when the row\n   is modified.\n\n * Field-level Checks: Compares specific fields to determine if a conflict\n   exists.\n\n\nTIMESTAMP CONCURRENCY IN EF\n\nCONFIGURING TIMESTAMP CONCURRENCY\n\nIn EF, you can configure timestamp-based concurrency in your data models using\nthe [Timestamp] attribute in C#. This marks the property as a concurrency token.\n\nHere's how it's done in code:\n\npublic class MyEntity\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [Timestamp]\n    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nThe RowVersion property is the timestamp concurrency token. It has a special\n.HasColumnName() method to specify the actual column name in the database, if\nnecessary.\n\nOPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY CHECKS\n\nOptimistic concurrency checks occur automatically in EF when you attempt to save\nchanges to an object that has a timestamp property.\n\nHere's a typical usage example:\n\n// Retrieve an entity from the context\nvar entity = dbContext.MyEntities.Find(1);\n\n// Make some changes to the entity\nentity.Name = \"New Name\";\n\ntry {\n    // Attempt to save changes\n    dbContext.SaveChanges();\n} catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException) {\n    // Handle the exception\n}\n\n\nIf another user has updated the same record since you originally queried it, a\nDbUpdateConcurrencyException is thrown, indicating a concurrency conflict.

They enable systems like Entity Framework Code-First to\nimplement optimistic concurrency control.\n\n\nCONCURRENCY AND TIMESTAMPS IN EF CODE-FIRST\n\nIn the EF Code-First approach, to enable concurrency checks using timestamps:\n\n 1. Add the [Timestamp] attribute to the property in your model that should be\n    used for concurrency checks. Typically, this would be the RowVersion\n    property.\n\n 2. Configure the mapping using Fluent API to indicate the property's\n    concurrency mode. This is necessary because Entity Framework Code-First by\n    default assumes that all properties are read and written to the database. By\n    specifying a concurrency mode, EF knows that it should include the property\n    in generated SQL statements to detect concurrency conflicts:\n    \n    * C# Example:\n    \n    public class MyEntityConfiguration : EntityTypeConfiguration<MyEntity>\n    {\n        public MyEntityConfiguration()\n        {\n            Property(e => e.RowVersion).IsRowVersion();\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n 3. When performing an update operation, EF will include the RowVersion property\n    in the WHERE clause of the SQL update statement to validate that the row has\n    not been modified since it was last read.\n\nPitfalls and Tips:\n\n * It's important to remember that if the entity is loaded in one context and\n   updated in another, the generated timestamp value might not reflect the\n   latest database state.\n\n * Keep in mind that some database providers have specific requirements or\n   limitations when using row versions for concurrency checks. Ensure that your\n   chosen provider supports this feature. For example, not all databases support\n   timestamp fields for concurrency.\n\n * The [Timestamp] attribute in EF does not map to a database timestamp or\n   rowversion data type. It's designed to be used as a form of concurrency\n   control, hence the name \"timestamp\" in EF's context.\n\n * To optimize performance, EF uses an in-memory cache for certain operations,\n   which means that timestamp or row version-based concurrency checks might not\n   be performed consistently until changes are saved to the database.\n\n * It's essential to test the behavior of your application, especially if it\n   involves distributed scenarios, to ensure that concurrency checks work as\n   intended in all use cases.","index":48,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"50.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE TYPES OF CONCURRENCY PATTERNS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITH EF?","answer":"Entity Framework supports various concurrency patterns to handle updates and\nconflicting changes.\n\n\nCONCURRENCY MODES\n\n * Last Writer Wins (LWW):\n   \n   * This mode is the default when a database field doesn't have a specific\n     configuration.

Efficiency Metrics Assessment: Consider both database and application-side\n    metrics relevant to EF performance:\n    \n    * Database Metrics: Identify slow queries and monitor server resource usage.\n    * Application Metrics: Evaluate factors such as the amount of data being\n      loaded and the number of database round-trips. Tools like EF Profiler can\n      be especially useful here.\n\n 2. Identify Bottlenecks using Profilers: Choose a profiler that works well with\n    EF. Use it to see which queries take the most time, how often they are\n    executed, and what underlying SQL is generated.\n\n 3. Code Inspection: Perform a thorough examination of the codebase to pinpoint\n    any potential performance pitfalls, such as unneeded eager loading or\n    extensive object graphs.\n\n 4. Query and Execution Plan Analysis:\n    \n    * SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Use Query Execution Plan to check for\n      query bottlenecks and ways to optimize.\n    * SQL Profiler: Trace and analyze how SQL statements are functioning in\n      real-time.\n    * SQL Query Tuning: This approach is effective for complex queries that\n      demonstrate poor performance, especially after analyzing the query\n      execution plan.\n\n 5. Database Tuning: Normalize database data and validate hardware and tuning\n    configuration for the database server.\n\n\nTUNING AND OPTIMIZATION\n\nIN-MEMORY CACHE IMPLEMENTATION\n\nOne effective way to optimize EF performance is by introducing an in-memory\ncache mechanism to reduce recurrent database calls, best for read-heavy\napplications over large datasets. Redis, Memcached, or a distributed cache are\ncommon choices.\n\nBelow is the C#:\n\npublic class MyDbContext : DbContext\n{\n    public MyDbContext()\n    {\n        // Disable automatic change tracking for improved performance in read-heavy scenarios\n        ChangeTracker.QueryTrackingBehavior = QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking;\n    }\n\n    public List<Customer> GetCustomers()\n    {\n        var cacheKey = \"Customers\";  // Consider using better cache keys\n        if (!MemoryCache.Default.Contains(cacheKey))\n        {\n            var customers = Customers.ToList();\n            MemoryCache.Default.Add(cacheKey, customers, DateTimeOffset.MaxValue);\n        }\n        return MemoryCache.Default.Get(cacheKey) as List<Customer>;\n    }\n}\n\n\nASYNCHRONOUS QUERY EXECUTION\n\nLeverage asynchronous methods in EF. This is especially beneficial in scenarios\nwhere database operations can run concurrently with application tasks.\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic async Task<List<Customer>> GetCustomersAsync()\n{\n    using (var context = new MyDbContext())\n    {\n        return await context.Customers.ToListAsync();\n    }\n}\n\n\nLAZY LOADING AND EAGER LOADING STRATEGIES\n\nOptimize entity loading with these strategies:\n\n * Use Lazy Loading when dealing with large datasets and need to load entities\n   on-demand.\n * Eager loading, on the other hand, is preferable when multiple entities are to\n   be retrieved in one go. The .Include() method is often used for this.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n// Lazy Loading: Loads orders only when accessed\npublic virtual ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n\n// Eager Loading: Loads orders at the time of customer fetching\nvar customers = context.Customers.Include(c => c.Orders).ToList();\n\n\nDATA ACCESS LAYER REFINEMENT\n\nKeep the data access code consolidated in a dedicated layer and assess\nefficiency across its components. Furthermore, utilize stored procedures in EF\nto bring about further performance gains.\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class CustomerRepository\n{\n    private MyDbContext _context;\n\n    public CustomerRepository(MyDbContext context)\n    {\n        _context = context;\n    }\n\n    public List<Customer> GetCustomersUsingStoredProcedure()\n    {\n        return _context.Database.SqlQuery<Customer>(\"exec GetCustomers\").ToList();\n    }\n}\n\n\nBATCHING STATEMENTS FOR MULTIPLE OPERATIONS\n\nMinimize round-trips to the database server by grouping similar operations. This\ncan lead to enhanced performance, particularly when dealing with a substantial\nnumber of entities.\n\nHere is the C#:\n\npublic void SaveBatchOfCustomers(List<Customer> customers)\n{\n    using (var context = new MyDbContext())\n    {\n        context.Customers.AddRange(customers);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n    }\n}\n\n\nCONTEXT LIFETIME OPTIMIZATION\n\nAssess and restrict the lifecycle of your DbContext. As a rule of thumb, keep\nthe scope as narrow as reasonable.\n\nHere is the C#:\n\n// Using a context per operation, potentially split across entities, then disposed.\npublic void PerformMultipleContextOperations()\n{\n    using (var context1 = new MyDbContext())\n    using (var context2 = new MyDbContext())\n    {\n        var customer = new Customer { Name = \"John\" };\n        context1.Customers.Add(customer);\n        context1.SaveChanges();\n\n        // Do some processing...\n\n        customer.Age = 35;\n        context2.Entry(customer).State = EntityState.Modified;\n        context2.SaveChanges();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nCONTINUOUS VIGILANCE\n\nThe process of performance optimization in EF doesn't conclude with its\nexecution. Continuous monitoring of your application's performance in production\nand fine-tuning whenever necessary are pivotal to guaranteeing a consistent and\nhigh-performing user experience.\n\nChoose indicators and metrics, like average number of queries or average query\ntime, and monitor them routinely to ascertain that your application is meeting\nperformance benchmarks.\n\nMoreover, regularly inspect and track SQL server performance metrics to ensure\nthat it is realms away from performance degradation.","index":60,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"62.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE COMMON EXCEPTIONS IN EF AND HOW DO YOU RESOLVE THEM?","answer":"Let's look at common Entity Framework exceptions and their solutions.\n\n\nCOMMON EXCEPTIONS\n\n * InvalidOperationException: Often arises from an invalid operation such as\n   invoking SaveChanges on a context where changes are not being tracked.\n\n * DbUpdateException: Primarily due to database update failures.

Here are the common\nsteps for troubleshooting:\n\n\nCOMMON MIGRATIONS ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n1. OUT-OF-DATE MODEL\n\n * Issue: You've made changes to your model, but these are not reflected in the\n   database.\n * Solution: Generate a new migration and update the database.\n\n2. DATABASE STATE MISMATCHES THE MODEL\n\n * Issue: Your database state doesn't match the defined model, which can occur\n   if you manipulate the database outside EF Migrations.\n\n * Solution: Synchronize the database state with the model:\n   \n   * Safe Scenario: If you made reversible changes outside migrations (e.g., you\n     deleted a few rows directly), create a dummy migration to document and\n     execute these changes.\n   \n   * Unsafe Scenario: If the database state can't be safely synchronized with\n     the model, consider dropping and recreating the database from scratch.\n\n3. MIGRATIONS BEING APPLIED IN THE WRONG ORDER\n\n * Issue: Migrations are getting applied in a different order than what you\n   expect, leading to issues and possibly data loss.\n\n * Solution:\n   \n   * In EF6: Manually ensure that the database knows about all migration\n     classes.\n   \n   * In EF Core: Double-check that every migration in your MigrationsHistory\n     table has its corresponding migration class.\n\n4. CODE AND DATABASE ELEMENTS OUT OF SYNC\n\n * Issue: Your model code and the database are out of sync, leading to potential\n   model/database mismatch issues.\n * Solution: Verify and match your database state with your code model. If\n   you're using EF Core, you can benefit from the in-built\n   DbContext.Database.EnsureCreated() or DbContext.Database.Migrate() methods.\n   Use EnsureCreated() during development where a stable schema ensures less\n   impact and use Migrate() during application startup to apply new migrations.\n\n5. DATA LOSS IS IMMINENT\n\n * Issue: You need to ensure that a migration won't result in data loss. EF Core\n   may mark a migration as requiring manual changes when data loss is possible\n   based on schema changes.\n * Solution: In EF Core: Either let EF Core handle this by overriding the\n   OnModelCreating method in your DbContext or specify whether data loss should\n   be allowed with MigrationBuilder APIs.\n\n6. INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN EF VERSIONS\n\n * Issue: Your project might be targeting both EF Core and EF6, leading to\n   possible compatibility issues between these versions.\n * Solution: Ensure that only one version of EF is in use.\n\n7. OPTIMIZING MIGRATIONS FOR LARGE DATASETS\n\n * Issue: Migrations can take considerable time to apply, especially on large\n   datasets.\n * Solution: Minimize data modifications within a single migration.\n\n8. HANDLING DATABASE TRANSITIONS\n\n * Issue: The process of transitioning databases (e.g., while switching\n   providers) can be challenging or might result in data or schema loss.\n * Solution: With EF Core, consider different strategies such as Swappable\n   Providers or Migrations with Multi-Provider.\n\n9. UNDOING CHANGES\n\n * Issue: You made a mistake while applying a migration and need to roll it\n   back.\n * Solution: Use the Update-Database command with a TargetMigration or Migration\n   parameter to specify the migration you want to roll back to.\n\n10. MIGRATIONS PENDING IN SOURCE CONTROL\n\n * Issue: When using source control, migrations that were created (but not\n   applied) on a development machine might not have been committed and pushed to\n   the shared repository.\n * Solution: Ensure that all pending migrations are correctly added and\n   committed in your source control system.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR EFFICIENT HANDLING OF MIGRATIONS\n\n * Use a Single Source of Truth: Ensure that all schema modifications are\n   captured through migrations, from local development to production.\n\n * Version Control for Migrations: Migrations are code and should be managed\n   under version control systems. This ensures consistency when applying\n   migrations across environments and simultaneously aids in tracking changes to\n   the database schema.\n\n * Script Migrations for Production: Instead of applying migrations directly to\n   a production database, generate SQL scripts and review them before executing\n   to avoid surprises or potential downtime.\n\n * Zero-Downtime Migrations: For continuous operations, apply migrations without\n   causing downtime : leading to Atomic Deployments and Zero-Downtime\n   migrations.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTOOLS LIKE EF FOR ADVANCED MIGRATIONS\n\nBoth EF Core and EF6 provide a set of commands related to Migrations,\nsimplifying common operational tasks.

Each of these\naligns better with certain application types and use-cases.\n\n\nTRANSIENT\n\nA new DbContext is created each time it is required. With this method, you can\nincorporate dependency injection in your application to ensure objects are\ndecoupled and have a short lifespan.\n\nEXAMPLE: DEPENDENCY INJECTION WITH TRANSIENT DBCONTEXT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// Configure the DBContext as transient for DI container\nservices.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(ServiceLifetime.Transient);\n\n// Request a DB context\npublic class YourService\n{\n    private readonly YourDbContext _context;\n\n    public YourService(YourDbContext context)\n    {\n        _context = context;\n    }\n\n    // Method using the context\n    // ...\n}\n\n\n\nSCOPED\n\nThe DbContext is created per request or client use. In multi-user applications,\neach user or request gets its own DbContext. The DbContext is disposed of when\nthe scope is complete, achieving resource cleanup.\n\nEXAMPLE: HTTP REQUEST SCOPED DBCONTEXT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// Register the DB context with HTTP request scope\nservices.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(ServiceLifetime.Scoped);\n\n// In an API Controller\npublic class YourController : ControllerBase\n{\n    private readonly YourDbContext _context;\n\n    public YourController(YourDbContext context)\n    {\n        _context = context;\n    }\n\n    // ... API actions using the context\n}\n\n\n\nSINGLETON\n\nThe DbContext is instantiated once and shared across the application lifespan.\nThis might lead to thread safety concerns in multi-threaded environments. Its\nuse should be limited to thread-safe scenarios or read-only operations.\n\nEXAMPLE: SINGLETON DBCONTEXT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// Register the DB context as a singleton\nservices.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(ServiceLifetime.Singleton);\n\n// In a controller\npublic class YourController : ControllerBase\n{\n    static YourDbContext _context;\n\n    static YourController()\n    {\n        var sp = new ServiceCollection().AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(ServiceLifetime.Singleton).BuildServiceProvider();\n        _context = sp.GetRequiredService<YourDbContext>();\n    }\n\n    // ... Other actions using the static context\n}\n\n\n\nHYBRID APPROACHES AND ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSome applications may employ hybrid methods such as transient DbContexts for\nread operations and scoped ones for more significant, e.g., write, operations.\nHowever, this can result in increased complexity and should be done with\ncaution.\n\nAdditionally, there are some cases when using a lifetime that is too long, like\nSingleton (especially in web applications), can lead to negative consequences\nsuch as a stagnant data context.\n\nSelecting the appropriate method for your DbContext is vital to ensure its\nresources are managed effectively.

DEPENDENCY INJECTION\n\nDevelopers use containers and patterns like Inversion of Control (IoC) to manage\ndependencies in .NET or other languages. Such patterns are often used with EF.\n\nExample:\n\n// In your composition root\nvar context = new MyDbContext();\nvar myService = new MyService(context);\n\n// With IoC\nvar context = new MyDbContext();\nservices.AddScoped<IMyService>(sp => new MyService(context));\n\n\n5. MODEL-VIEW-VIEWMODEL (MVVM) ARCHITECTURE\n\nWidely used for WPF and XAML-based applications, MVVM architecture abstracts\nDataContext for easy interaction with EF and LINQ.\n\n6. SCRIPT BUNDLING AND MINIFICATION\n\nWhile not directly related to EF, script bundling and minification help optimize\nclient-side resources. Techniques like this can improve EF integration through\nreduced page load times.\n\nExample (ASP.NET MVC):\n\nbundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jquery\").Include(\n    \"~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js\"));\n\n\n7. OBJECT-RELATIONAL MAPPING (ORM) TOOLS\n\nEF serves as an effective ORM tool, bridging object-oriented and relational\nparadigms.

API Changes: EF6 and EF Core have different APIs for database interaction.\n 2. Behavioral Changes: Some behavior, such as model configuration, differs\n    between the two versions.\n 3. Missing Features: EF Core might lack certain features present in EF6.\n\n\nSTEPS FOR MIGRATION\n\n1. UPDATE NUGET PACKAGES AND DEPENDENCIES\n\n * First, update the EF6 and other related packages to the latest version.\n\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\n# Additional packages if needed:\n# dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n# dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools\n\n\n2. RESOLVE API DIFFERENCES\n\n * Replace EF6's constructs with their EF Core equivalents. For example, replace\n   SaveChanges with SaveChanges or SaveChangesAsync.\n * Consider using the EF Upgrade Assistant tool for help in changing code.The\n   tool will identify common upgrade issues, such as obsolete methods.\n\n// Replace this in EF6\nvar book = context.Books.SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == id);\n\n// With this in EF Core\nvar book = context.Books.Find(id);\n\n\n3. HANDLE THE CHANGE IN CONFIGURATION\n\n * While OnModelCreating from EF6 is similar to its Core counterpart, ensure you\n   update ModelBuilder usages, key mapping, and relations.\n\n * Fluent API declarations can also be different, e.g., from HasKey to HasKey.\n   -EF Core uses the HasConversion method to convert between types, whereas EF6\n   uses the IDbModelCacheKey property.\n\n * EF Core provides a HasDefaultValueSql method that EF6 does not provide.\n\n// EF6\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Person>().Property(p => p.BirthDate).HasColumnName(\"Birthday\");\n\n// EF Core\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Person>().Property(p => p.BirthDate).HasColumnName(\"Birthday\");\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()\n    .Property(p => p.Rating)\n    .HasConversion(\n        v => (int)v,\n        v => (Rating)v\n    )\n    .HasColumnType(\"enum('Low', 'High')\")\n    .HasDefaultValue(Rating.Low);\n\n\n4. MODIFY QUERIES\n\n * Transition LINQ queries to EF Core-appropriate syntax.\n * Explicit Loading: EF Core uses the Load method, while EF6 uses Include.\n * Raw SQL Queries: EF Core adopts raw SQL through FromSqlRaw, coupled with the\n   ExecuteSqlCommand.\n * The Include Method: It is more flexible in EF Core and requires updating to\n   take advantage of the improved functionality.\n\n5. ADJUST THE CODEBASE\n\n * Review and update code that might be influenced by changes in behavior or\n   missing features.\n\n6. TEST THE MODIFICATIONS THOROUGHLY\n\n * Validate that the modified codebase upholds the migration goals and doesn't\n   introduce new issues.\n * Execute both unit tests and integration tests to ascertain that the database\n   action is consistent.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONTEXT UPDATE\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// EF6\npublic class LibraryContext : DbContext\n{\n    public LibraryContext() : base(\"name=LibraryContext\") { }\n    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }\n    public DbSet<Author> Authors { get; set; }\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n    {\n        // Model Configuration\n        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\n    }\n}\n\n// EF Core\npublic class LibraryContext : DbContext\n{\n    public LibraryContext(DbContextOptions<LibraryContext> options) : base(options) { }\n    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }\n    public DbSet<Author> Authors { get; set; }\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n    {\n        // Model Configuration\n        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\n    }\n}\n","index":94,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"96.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MANAGE DATABASE INITIALIZATION STRATEGIES IN EF?","answer":"Entity Framework (EF) provides several strategies for initializing databases,\nwhich can vary from the simplest approach of creating databases if they don't\nexist to more specialized solutions like migrations.\n\n\nEF DATABASE INITIALIZATION STRATEGIES\n\n 1. Create Database If Not Exists\n    \n    This strategy ensures that if there's no database defined for the context,\n    one is created. However, if the model changes, this method won't update the\n    database to reflect the changes.\n    \n    By Data Annotation:\n    \n    using System.Data.Entity;\n    \n    public class MyContext : DbContext\n    {\n        public MyContext() : base(\"name=MyContext\")\n        {\n            Database.SetInitializer(new CreateDatabaseIfNotExists<MyContext>());\n        }\n    }\n    \n    \n    By Fluent API:\n    \n    using System.Data.Entity;\n    \n    modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()\n        .Map(m => m\n            .AutoMap(DERIVED)\n            .Table(\"blogs\"))\n        .Map<ReadOnlyBlog>(m => m.ToTable(\"ReadOnlyBlogs\"));\n    \n\n 2. DropCreateDatabaseAlways or DropCreateAlways\n    \n    These strategies drop the existing database and create a new one each time\n    the application is initialized. While these methods are good for quick\n    development and testing, they should not be used in production.\n    \n    By Data Annotation:\n    \n    using System.Data.Entity;\n    \n    public class MyContext : DbContext\n    {\n        public MyContext() : base(\"name=MyContext\")\n        {\n            Database.SetInitializer(new DropCreateDatabaseAlways<MyContext>());\n        }\n    }\n    \n    \n    Quick Tip:\n    To specifically use \"DropCreateDatabaseAlways\" or \"DropCreateAlways\", create\n    an initializer instance:\n    \n    Database.SetInitializer(new DropCreateDatabaseAlways<MyContext>());\n    \n\n 3. MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion\n    \n    This strategy uses migrations to ensure the database is up-to-date with the\n    latest model. If the database doesn't exist, it will be created and all\n    pending migrations will be applied.\n    \n    By Data Annotation:\n    \n    using System.Data.Entity;\n    \n    public class MyContext : DbContext\n    {\n        public MyContext() : base(\"name=MyContext\")\n        {\n            Database.SetInitializer(new MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion<MyContext, Configuration>());\n        }\n    }\n    \n    \n    Make sure that Configuration is enabling migrations for your context.\n\n 4. Custom Initializers\n    \n    Developers can also create their own custom initializers by extending\n    IDatabaseInitializer. This approach is flexible and can cater to specific\n    requirements that aren't covered by the built-in strategies.\n    \n    Order of Initialization:\n    Ensure that Database.SetInitializer is called before any operation that\n    would touch the database or access the context. The best practice is to set\n    the initializer in the constructor of the context.\n    \n    Example of Custom Initializer:\n    \n    public class MyDropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges : DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges<MyContext>\n    {\n        protected override void Seed(MyContext context)\n        {\n            // Add seed data here\n        }\n    }\n    public class MyContext : DbContext\n    {\n        public MyContext()\n        : base(\"name=MyContext\")\n        {\n            Database.SetInitializer(new MyDropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges());\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Development Environment:\n   \n   * For rapid iteration, consider using methods like \"DropCreateDatabaseAlways\"\n     for a consistently clean start.\n   * Move to more precise strategies, like \"MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion,\" as\n     your model stabilizes.\n\n * Production Environment:\n   \n   * Aim for stability by relying on the default, create-database-if-not-exists\n     strategy.\n   * Ensure thorough testing if any migration strategies are implemented.\n\n\nFURTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Execution Time: Initialization strategies are primarily executed during the\n   first operation that requires a database to be interacted with in a context.\n   This means they can be set at any time before the context is used, but they\n   are not executed until the first database operation occurs.\n * Integration with Migrations: Using \"MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion\" with EF\n   Code First Migrations takes care of both schema and data modifications,\n   making it a powerful all-in-one solution.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * For quick prototyping, consider the \"DropCreateDatabaseAlways\" method.\n * For consistent development, implement more predictable strategies.\n * In production, use a cautious approach: design the database first, carry out\n   extensive testing, and utilize \"CreateDatabaseIfNotExists\".","index":95,"topic":" Entity Framework ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"97.\n\n\nCAN EF BE USED WITH NONSUPPORTED DATABASES THROUGH CUSTOM

all SQL\nServer-specific features, falling short in areas such as hierarchyID and\ngeography types. However, beginning with EF 6, many of these limitations were\novercome.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES WITH MICROSOFT SQL SERVER\n\nGLOBAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (GUID) COLUMNS\n\nGUIDs are alphanumeric identifiers, useful for generating unique values across\nvarious databases. EF natively supports their use as primary keys or ordinary\nattributes.\n\nYou can mandate a string property, such as a GUID, to be a primary key in your\ncode:\n\npublic class Item\n{\n    [Key]\n    public string ItemId { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nFULL-TEXT SEARCH\n\nSurpassing the standard SQL querying methods, Microsoft SQL Server's full-text\nsearch feature works in unison with EF. It ensures better efficiency for lookups\nstretched across larger bodies of text.\n\nTRIGGERS\n\nThese SQL database actions, such as insertions or reminders, can be associated\nwith EF operations under defined conditions.\n\n\nHIERARCHYID AND GEOGRAPHY TYPES\n\nSQL Server's hierarchyID, a native data class, concatenates textual values to\nbuild the hierarchy, for example, /1/, /1/1/, /1/1/1/. Although direct usage in\nEF might be tricky, you can harness hierarchical data through richer coding.\n\nLikewise, geography types, handling geographical coordinates, are compatible\nthrough EF. You can persist geographic locations in your C# codebase, and EF\nensures their storage and retrieval from the SQL Server.\n\nENABLING HIERARCHYID AND GEOGRAPHY TYPES\n\nWhen integrating a spatial data type, such as geography or geometry, install the\n\"Microsoft.SqlServer.Types\" NuGet package from Microsoft and manually merge that\ntype into your SQL Server.\n\nFor older versions of SQL Server, relocate the DLL on the server hosting the EF\napplication, or the runtime might fail to recognize spatial data types.\nManagement Studio or the latest SQL Server Data Tools editions provide workflows\nto update both server and client resources.
