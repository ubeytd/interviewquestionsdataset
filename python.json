EXTENSIBLE\n\nWith its C-language API, developers can integrate performance-critical tasks and\nexisting C modules with Python.","index":0,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nHOW IS PYTHON EXECUTED?","answer":"Python source code is processed through various steps before it can be executed.\nLet's explore the key stages in this process.\n\n\nCOMPILATION & INTERPRETATION\n\nPython code goes through both compilation and interpretation.\n\n * Bytecode Compilation: High-level Python code is transformed into low-level\n   bytecode by the Python interpreter with the help of a compiler. Bytecode is a\n   set of instructions that Python's virtual machine (PVM) can understand and\n   execute.\n\n * On-the-fly Interpretation: The PVM reads and executes bytecode instructions\n   in a step-by-step manner.\n\nThis dual approach known as \"compile and then interpret\" is what sets Python\n(and certain other languages) apart.\n\n\nBYTECODE VERSUS MACHINE CODE EXECUTION\n\nWhile some programming languages compile directly to machine code, Python\ncompiles to bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the Python virtual\nmachine. This extra step of bytecode execution can make Python slower in certain\nuse-cases when compared to languages that compile directly to machine code.\n\nThe advantage, however, is that bytecode is platform-independent. A Python\nprogram can be run on any machine with a compatible PVM, ensuring cross-platform\nsupport.\n\n\nSOURCE CODE TO BYTECODE: COMPILATION STEPS\n\n 1. Lexical Analysis: The source code is broken down into tokens, identifying\n    characters and symbols for Python to understand.\n 2. Syntax Parsing: Tokens are structured into a parse tree to establish the\n    code's syntax and grammar.\n 3. Semantic Analysis: Code is analyzed for its meaning and context, ensuring\n    it's logically sound.\n 4. Bytecode Generation: Based on the previous steps, bytecode instructions are\n    created.\n\n\nJUST-IN-TIME (JIT) COMPILATION\n\nWhile Python typically uses a combination of interpretation and compilation, JIT\nboosts efficiency by selectively compiling parts of the program that are\nfrequently used or could benefit from optimization.\n\nJIT compiles sections of the program to machine code on-the-fly. This direct\nmachine code generation for frequently executed parts can significantly speed up\nthose segments, blurring the line between traditional interpreters and\ncompilers.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DISASSEMBLY OF BYTECODE\n\nimport dis\n\ndef example_func():\n    return 15 * 20\n\n# Disassemble to view bytecode instructions\ndis.dis(example_func)\n\n\nDisassembling code using Python's dis module can reveal the underlying bytecode\ninstructions that the PVM executes. Here's the disassembled output for the above\ncode:\n\n  4           0 LOAD_CONST               2 (300)\n              2 RETURN_VALUE\n","index":1,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT IS PEP 8 AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?","answer":"PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code that promotes code consistency,\nreadability, and maintainability. It's named after Python Enhancement Proposal\n(PEP), the mechanism used to propose and standardize changes to the Python\nlanguage.\n\nPEP 8 is not a set-in-stone rule book, but it provides general guidelines that\nhelp developers across the Python community write code that's visually\nconsistent and thus easier to understand.\n\n\nKEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES\n\nPEP 8 emphasizes:\n\n * Readability: Code should be easy to read and understand, even by someone who\n   didn't write it.\n * Consistency: Codebase should adhere to a predictable style so there's little\n   cognitive load in reading or making changes.\n * One Way to Do It: Instead of offering multiple ways to write the same\n   construct, PEP 8 advocates for a single, idiomatic style.\n\n\nBASE RULES\n\n * Indentation: Use 4 spaces for each level of logical indentation.\n * Line Length: Keep lines of code limited to 79 characters. This number is a\n   guideline; longer lines are acceptable in certain contexts.\n * Blank Lines: Use them to separate logical sections but not excessively.\n\n\nNAMING STYLES\n\n * Class Names: Prefer CamelCase.\n * Function and Variable Names: Use lowercase_with_underscores.\n * Module Names: Keep them short and in lowercase.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\n * Use triple quotes for documentation strings.\n * Comments should be on their own line and explain the reason for the following\n   code block.\n\n\nWHITESPACE USAGE\n\n * Operators: Surround them with a single space.\n * Commas: Follow them with a space.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: DIRECTORY WALKER\n\nHere is the PEP8 compliant code:\n\nimport os\n\ndef walk_directory(path):\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path):\n        for filename in filenames:\n            file_path = os.path.join(dirpath, filename)\n            print(file_path)\n\nwalk_directory('/path/to/directory')\n","index":2,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nHOW IS MEMORY ALLOCATION AND GARBAGE COLLECTION HANDLED IN PYTHON?","answer":"In Python, both memory allocation and garbage collection are handled discretely.\n\n\nMEMORY ALLOCATION\n\n * The \"heap\" is the pool of memory for storing objects. The Python memory\n   manager allocates and deallocates this space as needed.\n\n * In latest Python versions, the obmalloc system is responsible for small\n   object allocations. This system preallocates small and medium-sized memory\n   blocks to manage frequently created small objects.\n\n * The allocator abstracts the system-level memory management, employing memory\n   management libraries like Glibc to interact with the operating system.\n\n * Larger blocks of memory are primarily obtained directly from the operating\n   system.\n\n * Stack and Heap separation is joined by \"Pool Allocator\" for internal use.\n\n\nGARBAGE COLLECTION\n\nPython employs a method called reference counting along with a cycle-detecting\ngarbage collector.\n\nREFERENCE COUNTING\n\n * Every object has a reference count. When an object's count drops to zero, it\n   is immediately deallocated.\n\n * This mechanism is swift, often releasing objects instantly without the need\n   for garbage collection.\n\n * However, it can be insufficient in handling circular references.\n\nCYCLE-DETECTING GARBAGE COLLECTOR\n\n * Python has a separate garbage collector that periodically identifies and\n   deals with circular references.\n\n * This is, however, a more time-consuming process and is invoked less\n   frequently than reference counting.\n\n\nMEMORY MANAGEMENT IN PYTHON VS. C\n\nPython handles memory management quite differently from languages like C or C++:\n\n * In Python, the developer isn't directly responsible for memory allocations or\n   deallocations, reducing the likelihood of memory-related bugs.\n\n * The memory manager in Python is what's known as a \"general-purpose memory\n   manager\" that can be slower than the dedicated memory managers of C or C++ in\n   certain contexts.\n\n * Python, especially due to the existence of a garbage collector, might have\n   memory overhead compared to C or C++ where manual memory management often\n   results in minimal overhead is one of the factors that might contribute to\n   Python's sometimes slower performance.\n\n * The level of memory efficiency isn't as high as that of C or C++. This is\n   because Python is designed to be convenient and easy to use, often at the\n   expense of some performance optimization.","index":3,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE BUILT-IN DATA TYPES IN PYTHON?","answer":"Python offers numerous built-in data types that provide varying functionalities\nand utilities.\n\n\nIMMUTABLE DATA TYPES\n\n1.

Key components of exception\nhandling in Python include:\n\n\nCOMPONENTS\n\n * Try: The section of code where exceptions might occur is placed within a try\n   block.\n\n * Except: Any possible exceptions that are raised by the try block are caught\n   and handled in the except block.\n\n * Finally: This block ensures a piece of code always executes, regardless of\n   whether an exception occurred. It's commonly used for cleanup operations,\n   such as closing files or database connections.\n\n\nGENERIC EXCEPTION HANDLING VS. HANDLING SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS\n\nIt's good practice to handle specific exceptions. However, a more general\napproach can also be taken. When doing the latter, ensure the general exception\nhandling is at the end of the chain, as shown here:\n\ntry:\n    risky_operation()\nexcept IndexError:  # Handle specific exception types first.\n    handle_index_error()\nexcept Exception as e:  # More general exception must come last.\n    handle_generic_error()\nfinally:\n    cleanup()\n\n\n\nRAISING EXCEPTIONS\n\nUse this mechanism to trigger and manage exceptions under specific\ncircumstances. This can be particularly useful when building custom classes or\nfunctions where specific conditions should be met.\n\nRaise a specific exception:\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Divisor cannot be zero\")\n    return a / b\n\ntry:\n    result = divide(4, 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(e)\n\n\nRaise a general exception:\n\ndef some_risky_operation():\n    if condition: \n        raise Exception(\"Some generic error occurred\")\n\n\n\nUSING WITH FOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\n\nThe with keyword provides a more efficient and clean way to handle resources,\nlike files, ensuring their proper closure when operations are complete or in\ncase of any exceptions. The resource should implement a context manager,\ntypically by having __enter__ and __exit__ methods.\n\nHere's an example using a file:\n\nwith open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    data = file.read()\n# File is automatically closed when the block is exited.\n\n\n\nSILENCE WITH PASS, CONTINUE, OR ELSE\n\nThere are times when not raising an exception is appropriate. You can use pass\nor continue in an exception block when you want to essentially ignore an\nexception and proceed with the rest of your code.\n\n * pass: Simply does nothing. It acts as a placeholder.\n   \n   try:\n       risky_operation()\n   except SomeSpecificException:\n       pass\n   \n\n * continue: This keyword is generally used in loops. It moves to the next\n   iteration without executing the code that follows it within the block.\n   \n   for item in my_list:\n       try:\n           perform_something(item)\n       except ExceptionType:\n           continue\n       ```\n   \n   \n\n * else with try-except blocks: The else block after a try-except block will\n   only be executed if no exceptions are raised within the try block\n   \n   try:\n       some_function()\n   except SpecificException:\n       handle_specific_exception()\n   else:\n       no_exception_raised()\n   \n\n\nCALLBACK FUNCTION: EXCEPTIONHOOK\n\nPython 3 introduced the better handling of uncaught exceptions by providing an\noptional function for printing stack traces. The sys.excepthook can be set to\nmatch any exception in the module as long as it has a hook attribute.\n\nHere's an example for this test module:\n\n# test.py\nimport sys\n\ndef excepthook(type, value, traceback):\n    print(\"Unhandled exception:\", type, value)\n    # Call the default exception hook\n    sys.__excepthook__(type, value, traceback)\n\nsys.excepthook = excepthook\n\ndef test_exception_hook():\n    throw_some_exception()\n\n\nWhen run, calling test_exception_hook will print \"Unhandled exception: ...\"\n\nNote: sys.excepthook will not capture exceptions raised as the result of\ninteractive prompt commands, such as SyntaxError or KeyboardInterrupt.","index":6,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIST AND TUPLE?","answer":"Lists and Tuples in Python share many similarities, such as being sequences and\nsupporting indexing.\n\nHowever, these data structures differ in key ways:\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\n * Mutability: Lists are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify\n   elements after creation. Tuples, once created, are immutable.\n\n * Performance: Lists are generally slower than tuples, most apparent in tasks\n   like iteration and function calls.\n\n * Syntax: Lists are defined with square brackets [], whereas tuples use\n   parentheses ().\n\n\nWHEN TO USE EACH\n\n * Lists are ideal for collections that may change in size and content.

Literal Definition: Define key-value pairs within curly braces { }.\n\n 2. From Key-Value Pairs: Use the dict() constructor or the {key: value}\n    shorthand.\n\n 3. Using the dict() Constructor: This can accept another dictionary, a sequence\n    of key-value pairs, or named arguments.\n\n 4. Comprehensions: This is a concise way to create dictionaries using a single\n    line of code.\n\n 5. zip() Function: This creates a dictionary by zipping two lists, where the\n    first list corresponds to the keys, and the second to the values.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nDICTIONARY LITERAL DEFINITION\n\nHere is a Python code:\n\n# Dictionary literal definition\nstudent = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 21,\n    \"courses\": [\"Math\", \"Physics\"]\n}\n\n\nFROM KEY-VALUE PAIRS\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Using the `dict()` constructor\nstudent_dict = dict([\n    (\"name\", \"John Doe\"),\n    (\"age\", 21),\n    (\"courses\", [\"Math\", \"Physics\"])\n])\n\n# Using the shorthand syntax\nstudent_dict_short = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 21,\n    \"courses\": [\"Math\", \"Physics\"]\n}\n\n\nUSING ZIP()\n\nHere is a Python code:\n\nkeys = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\n\nzipped = zip(keys, values)\ndict_from_zip = dict(zipped) # Result: {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n\n\nUSING DICT() CONSTRUCTOR\n\nHere is a Python code:\n\n# Sequence of key-value pairs\nstudent_dict2 = dict(name=\"Jane Doe\", age=22, courses=[\"Biology\", \"Chemistry\"])\n\n# From another dictionary\nstudent_dict_combined = dict(student, **student_dict2)\n","index":8,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"10.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN == AND IS OPERATOR IN PYTHON?","answer":"Both the == and is operators in Python are used for comparison, but they\nfunction differently.\n\n * The == operator checks for value equality.\n * The is operator, on the other hand, validates object identity,\n\nIn Python, every object is unique, identifiable by its memory address.

They enable reusability,\nmodularity, and encapsulation.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Function Signature: Denoted by the def keyword, it includes the function\n   name, parameters, and an optional return type.\n * Function Body: This section carries the core logic, often comprising\n   conditional checks, loops, and method invocations.\n * Return Statement: The function's output is determined by this statement. When\n   None is specified, the function returns by default.\n * Local Variables: These variables are scoped to the function and are only\n   accessible within it.\n\n\nEXECUTION PROCESS\n\nWhen a function is called:\n\n 1. Stack Allocation: A stack frame, also known as an activation record, is\n    created to manage the function's execution. This frame contains details like\n    the function's parameters, local variables, and instruction pointer.\n\n 2. Parameter Binding: The arguments passed during the function call are bound\n    to the respective parameters defined in the function header.\n\n 3. Function Execution: Control is transferred to the function body. The\n    statements in the body are executed in a sequential manner until the\n    function hits a return statement or the end of the function body.\n\n 4. Return: If a return statement is encountered, the function evaluates the\n    expression following the return and hands the value back to the caller. The\n    stack frame of the function is then popped from the call stack.\n\n 5. Post Execution: If there's no return statement, or if the function ends\n    without evaluating any return statement, None is implicitly returned.\n\n\nLOCAL VARIABLE SCOPE\n\n * Function Parameters: These are a precursor to local variables and are\n   instantiated with the values passed during function invocation.\n * Local Variables: Created using an assignment statement inside the function\n   and cease to exist when the function execution ends.\n * Nested Scopes: In functions within functions (closures), non-local variables\n   - those defined in the enclosing function - are accessible but not modifiable\n   by the inner function, without using the nonlocal keyword.\n\n\nGLOBAL VISIBILITY\n\nIf a variable is not defined within a function, the Python runtime will look for\nit in the global scope. This behavior enables functions to access and even\nmodify global variables.\n\n\nAVOIDING SIDE EFFECTS\n\nFunctions offer a level of encapsulation, potentially reducing side effects by\nensuring that data and variables are managed within a controlled environment.\nSuch containment can help enhance the robustness and predictability of a\ncodebase. As a best practice, minimizing the reliance on global variables can\nlead to more maintainable, reusable, and testable code.","index":10,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"12.\n\n\nWHAT IS A LAMBDA FUNCTION, AND WHERE WOULD YOU USE IT?","answer":"A Lambda function, or lambda, for short, is a small anonymous function defined\nusing the lambda keyword in Python.\n\nWhile you can certainly use named functions when you need a function for\nsomething in Python, there are places where a lambda expression is more\nsuitable.\n\n\nDISTINCTIVE FEATURES\n\n * Anonymity: Lambdas are not given a name in the traditional sense, making them\n   suited for one-off uses in your codebase.\n * Single Expression Body: Their body is limited to a single expression. This\n   can be an advantage for brevity but a restriction for larger, more complex\n   functions.\n * Implicit Return: There's no need for an explicit return statement.\n * Conciseness: Lambdas streamline the definition of straightforward functions.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * Map, Filter, and Reduce: Functions like map can take a lambda as a parameter,\n   allowing you to define simple transformations on the fly. For example,\n   doubling each element of a list can be achieved with list(map(lambda x: x*2,\n   my_list)).\n * List Comprehensions: They are a more Pythonic way of running the same map or\n   filter operations, often seen as an alternative to lambdas and map.\n * Sorting: Lambdas can serve as a custom key function, offering flexibility in\n   sort orders.\n * Callbacks: Often used in events where a function is needed to be executed\n   when an action occurs (e.g., button click).\n * Simple Functions: For functions that are so basic that giving them a name,\n   especially in more procedural code, would be overkill.\n\n\nNOTABLE LIMITATIONS\n\n * Lack of Verbose Readability: Named functions are generally preferred when\n   their intended use is obvious from the name. Lambdas can make code harder to\n   understand if they're complex or not used in a recognizable pattern.\n * No Formal Documentation: While the function's purpose should be apparent from\n   its content, a named function makes it easier to provide direct\n   documentation.

This is done primarily to keep the\ncode clean, maintainable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n\n\nHOW DECORATORS WORK\n\n * Decorators wrap a target function, allowing you to execute custom code before\n   and after that function.\n * They are typically higher-order functions that take a function as an argument\n   and return a new function.\n * This paradigm of \"functions that modify functions\" is often referred to as\n   metaprogramming.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * Authorization and Authentication: Control user access.\n * Logging: Record function calls and their parameters.\n * Caching: Store previous function results for quick access.\n * Validation: Verify input parameters or function output.\n * Task Scheduling: Execute a function at a specific time or on an event.\n * Counting and Profiling: Keep track of the number of function calls and their\n   execution time.\n\n\nUSING DECORATORS IN CODE\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom functools import wraps\n\n# 1. Basic Decorator\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    @wraps(func)  # Ensures the original function's metadata is preserved\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print('Something is happening before the function is called.')\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print('Something is happening after the function is called.')\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print('Hello!')\n\nsay_hello()\n\n# 2.

This file will\n   automatically function as a module.\n\n * Create a Blank Module: Start an empty file with no extension. Name the file\n   using the accepted module syntax, e.g., __init__, for it to act as a module.\n\nNext, use import to access the module and its functionality.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CREATING A MATH_OPERATIONS MODULE\n\nMODULE DEFINITION\n\nSave the below math_operations.py file :\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    return x / y\n\n\nMODULE USAGE\n\nYou can use math_operations module by using import as shown below:\n\nimport math_operations\n\nresult = math_operations.add(4, 5)\nprint(result)\n\nresult = math_operations.divide(10, 5)\nprint(result)\n\n\nEven though it is not required in the later versions of Python, you can also use\nstatement from math_operations import * to import all the members such as\nfunctions and classes at once:\n\nfrom math_operations import *  # Not recommended generally due to name collisions and readability concerns\n\nresult = add(3, 2)\nprint(result)\n\n\n\nBEST PRACTICE\n\nBefore submitting the code, let's make sure to follow the Best Practice:\n\n * Avoid Global Variables: Use a main() function.\n * Guard Against Code Execution on Import: To avoid unintended side effects,\n   use:\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\nThis makes sure that the block of code following if __name__ == \"__main__\": is\nonly executed when the module is run directly and not when imported as a module\nin another program.","index":14,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"16.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SHARE GLOBAL VARIABLES ACROSS MODULES?","answer":"Global variables shared across modules can lead to spaghetti code and make the\nsystem hard to maintain. However, occasional use might be necessary, and it's\ngood to know how to handle them. Python provides several mechanisms for sharing\nglobal variables.\n\n\nTECHNIQUES FOR SHARING GLOBAL VARIABLES\n\n 1. Using Direct Assignment: You can simply import the module containing the\n    global variable and then reference it directly.\n    \n    # module1.py\n    global_var = 10\n    \n    # module2.py\n    import module1\n    print(module1.global_var)  # Output: 10\n    \n\n 2. Using the global Keyword: It gives the module-level variables the scope of a\n    file.\n    \n    # module1.py\n    def set_global():\n        global global_var\n        global_var = 20\n    \n    # module2.py\n    import module1\n    print(module1.global_var)  # Output: 10\n    module1.set_global()\n    print(module1.global_var)  # Output: 20\n    \n\n 3. Using a Shared Reference: Objects shared through a reference can be modified\n    across files.\n    \n    # module1.py\n    shared_list = []\n    \n    # module2.py\n    import module1\n    module1.shared_list.append(10)\n    print(module1.shared_list)  # Output: [10]\n    \n\n\nIMPLICATIONS AND BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Overuse of Global Variables: Excessive reliance can make code hard to\n   understand and maintain. Whenever possible, prefer passing variables\n   explicitly.\n\n * Testing and Debugging: Global variables can make both these processes\n   challenging, often leading to hidden bugs. Minimize their use for efficient\n   testing and debugging.\n\n * Concurrency Considerations: In multi-threaded or multi-process systems,\n   managing changes to global variables becomes crucial. Advanced handling, like\n   using locks, may be required.\n\n\nPYTHON 3'S NONLOCAL KEYWORD\n\nPython 3 introduced the nonlocal keyword, which allows nested scopes to modify\nvariables from their enclosing scope.\n\n# Python 3\ndef outer_func():\n    nonlocal_var = 10\n    def inner_func():\n        nonlocal nonlocal_var\n        nonlocal_var = 20\n    inner_func()\n    print(nonlocal_var)  # Output: 20\nouter_func()\n\n\nThis feature can be handy when you have multiple levels of scope and avoid\nmaking a variable global when it's not intended to be.

Upon execution, the entirety of the script is\n   processed.\n\n * Unit Testing: Conditionally running unit tests when a script is executed\n   independently helps maintain code integrity and test suites.\n\n * Profiling: Profiler configuration exclusions can be made, thereby preventing\n   the script from profiling certain sections of code during import.\n\n * Cybersecurity Applications: The mechanism is leveraged to isolate and\n   safeguard sensitive network operations, like scanning, from inadvertent\n   execution when imported.\n\n\nPLUS POINT\n\n * Comprehensive Refactoring: The use of if name == 'main': signifies the code's\n   execution flow and purpose, providing valuable insights during maintenance or\n   modification.\n\n * Enhanced Code Readability: By delineating primary program logic from\n   supporting module code, the conditional statement fosters coherence and\n   readability.

Built-in Namespaces: These contain the names of all built-in functions and\n    exceptions like len() and BaseException. They are always present and don't\n    need to be imported.\n\n 2. Global Namespaces: These are created when a module is imported or when the\n    Python interpreter starts and persists until the interpreter terminates. It\n    contains names from various modules and any objects created at the top level\n    of a script.\n\n 3. Local or Function-Specific Namespaces: These namespaces are generated when a\n    function is called and discarded when the function terminates. They hold\n    names of local variables, parameters, and any nested functions.\n\n 4. Class-Specific Namespaces: These are created when a class is defined. They\n    store attributes linked with the class and its instances.\n\n 5. Instance-Specific Namespaces: These namespaces store instance attributes and\n    are specific to a particular class object.\n\n 6. Decorator Namespaces: Introduced with decorators, they handle namespace\n    management related to decorators and the objects on which they are defined.\n\n 7. Module-Specific Namespaces: Objects such as the module's file name,\n    functions, classes, and attributes defined in the module make up a module's\n    namespace.\n\n 8. Unbound Local Namespace: Introduced in Python 3, this namespace allows for\n    the differentiation between variables that are assigned values within a\n    function vs. those defined on a broader scope.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING VARIOUS NAMEPSACES\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n# Global Namespace\nmy_global_var = 10\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Local Namespace\n    my_local_var = 20\n    print(my_local_var)\n    \n    # Accessing Global Namespace\n    print(my_global_var)\n\nclass MyClass:\n    # Class Specific Namespace\n    class_var = 30\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Instance Specific Namespace\n        self.instance_var = 40\n\n# Module Specific Namespace\nmodule_var = 50\n\n# Built-in Namespace\nprint(len(\"Hello, World!\"))\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MIXING NAMESPACES WITH POTENTIAL ISSUES\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ni = 10\n\ndef some_function(i):\n    # Assigning a new value to 'i' creates a new variable \n    # in the local function namespace.\n    i = 20\n    print(i)\n\nsome_function(30)\nprint(i)  # Output: 10 (Unchanged)\n","index":17,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"19.\n\n\nHOW DOES A PYTHON MODULE SEARCH PATH WORK?","answer":"In Python, module imports are guided by a set of directories called the module\nsearch path.\n\n\nMODULE SEARCH PATH\n\nDEFAULT VALUES\n\n * Global: Configured at Python installation time.\n * User-specific: User's home directory, described in the PYTHONHOME environment\n   variable.\n\nSTACK-UP MECHANISM\n\n 1.

This can, in a way, control scope.\n\n\nPACKAGE DIRECTORIES\n\nPackages are directories that contain an __init__.py file. When a directory has\nan __init__.py file, Python understands it as a package. This mechanism allows\nfor hierarchical structuring of projects.\n\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE __INIT__.PY?\n\nThe __init__.py file is optional, but it's a good practice to have one.

However, modern libraries\n   like NumPy and Pandas that utilize C extensions can sometimes bypass GIL,\n   leading to improved efficiency for such tasks.\n\n * I/O-bound Tasks: For I/O-bound operations like HTTP requests or file system\n   access, GIL doesn't pose a hindrance.

This standard\nmodule is highly customizable and offers several logging levels for fine-grained\ncontrol.\n\n\nLOGGING LEVELS\n\nThe logging module provides the following standard logging levels:\n\n * DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnostic purposes.\n * INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n * WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened but the software is\n   still operational.\n * ERROR: A serious issue that might result in part of the program not\n   functioning.\n * CRITICAL: A severe issue that could prevent the complete operation of the\n   program.\n\n\nBASIC LOGGING CONFIGURATION\n\nBefore using any logging functions, you should ensure that the logging module is\nproperly configured. If not, Python uses a default configuration that routes log\nentries to the console and ignores messages with a level less than WARNING.\n\nHere is a basic example for setting up the logger:\n\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG)\nlogger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\n\n\n\nLOGGING METHODS\n\nThe logging module provides several methods that correspond to standard logging\nlevels:\n\n * logging.debug(...)\n * logging.info(...)\n * logging.warning(...)\n * logging.error(...)\n * logging.critical(...)\n\nYou can use these methods to log messages at the corresponding level.\n\nEXAMPLE: BASIC LOGGING\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nimport logging\n\n# Configure basic logging to write to a file\nlogging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\n\n# Log some messages\nlogger.debug('This is a debug message')\nlogger.info('This is an info message')\nlogger.warning('This is a warning message')\nlogger.error('This is an error message')\nlogger.critical('This is a critical message')\n\n\n\nLOGGING FORMATTERS\n\nYou can also customize the format of the log entries using formatters. This can\nbe helpful if you want to include additional details in your logs, such as the\ntime a message was recorded or the logging level.\n\nHere's an example of a custom log format:\n\nimport logging\n\n# Create a custom logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a formatter and add it to the handler\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# Create a file handler and set the level to debug\nfile_handler = logging.FileHandler('example.log')\nfile_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Add the file handler to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(file_handler)\n\n# Log some messages\nlogger.debug('This is a debug message')\nlogger.info('This is an info message')\nlogger.warning('This is a warning message')\nlogger.error('This is an error message')\nlogger.critical('This is a critical message')\n\n# You can also remove the file handler when done\nlogger.removeHandler(file_handler)\n\n\nIn this example, the log entries will include the time the message was recorded\n(%(asctime)s), the name of the logger (%(name)s), the logging level\n(%(levelname)s), and the log message itself.","index":47,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"49.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU USE ASSERTIONS IN PYTHON?","answer":"Assert statements in Python are used for debugging and early error detection.\nThey are especially useful during development, testing, and for sanity checking.\n\nWhen the assertion fails, this typically indicates a fundamental issue and might\nrequire investigation or correction.\n\nUsing assertions is crucial for ensuring that your codebase remains robust and\nthat functions are operating within predefined constraints.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * If the assertion is true, the program proceeds.\n * If it's false, an AssertionError is raised, pausing program execution.\n * Asserts can be disabled in optimized production code to minimize overhead.\n\n\nCOMMON USAGE SCENARIOS\n\n * Inputs and Outputs: Verifying that function inputs and outputs meet\n   expectations.\n * Invariants: Checking that variable and function state remains consistent. For\n   instance, ensuring that an object's attribute is of the expected data type.\n * Control Flow: Pausing the program if a certain condition isn't met.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Clarity Over Granularity: Use assertions judiciously, focusing on checks that\n   are essential to the code's behavior.\n * Clear Error Messages: Include meaningful messages that describe what is being\n   checked.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ASSERT IN ACTION\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    assert radius > 0, \"Radius must be positive.\"\n    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n\n# Now when `calculate_circle_area` is called, the assertion checks the radius:\n# calculate_circle_area(5)  # This will work fine.\n# calculate_circle_area(0)  # Raises AssertionError because the radius is not positive.\n# calculate_circle_area(-1)  # Also raises AssertionError.\n","index":48,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"50.\n\n\nWHAT IS A TRACEBACK, AND HOW DO YOU ANALYZE IT?","answer":"A Traceback in Python refers to the diagnostic information presented in the\nconsole when an error (exception) occurs. This includes the file, line number,\nand specific code context that led to the exception. It's an invaluable tool for\nlocating and resolving issues in your code.\n\n\nSTRUCTURE OF A TRACEBACK\n\nA typical Python Traceback includes:\n\n * Exception Type: The nature of the exception that occurred.\n * Exception Message: A detailed description of the error.\n * File Path: The file where the exception happened.\n * Line Number: The exact line of the code that triggered the exception.\n * Call Stack: The sequence of function calls leading to the exception.\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING THE TRACEBACK\n\n 1. Discover the Exception: Examine the type and message to understand the\n    underlying issue, whether it's a syntax error (like a SyntaxError), a value\n    error (like a ValueError), or another type of exception.\n\n 2. Locate the Error: Identify the file, line number, and associated code.\n\n 3. Analyze the Call Stack: Understand the sequence of function calls that led\n    to the exception. This call hierarchy, also known as the execution context,\n    can provide insights into unexpected program behavior.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nLet's say you have a file named calculator.py with the following code:\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    return a / b\n\ndef main():\n    x, y = 5, 0\n    result = divide(x, y)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\nIf you run this script and provide 0 as the second input to the divide function,\nthe following traceback is generated:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"calculator.py\", line 9, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"calculator.py\", line 7, in main\n    result = divide(x, y)\n  File \"calculator.py\", line 2, in divide\n    return a / b\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n\nThis traceback reveals that a ZeroDivisionError occurred in the divide function\n(defined in calculator.py on line 2) when it was called from main (in the same\nfile, on line 7). Providing 0 for the variable y leads to the division by zero.\n\n\nTIPS FOR USING TRACEBACKS\n\n 1. Handling Exceptions: You can catch exceptions to either mitigate the impact\n    of errors or provide a specific course of action in such circumstances.\n\n 2. Logging: Use the logging module to streamline error monitoring and response\n    within your applications.\n\n 3.

Run the App:\n    \n    * Go to your project directory in the terminal.\n    * Run flask run to start the Flask development server.\n\n 5. Code Example:\n    \n    * app.py:\n    \n    from flask import Flask\n    from flask_restful import Api\n    from resources import Todo\n    \n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    api = Api(app)\n    \n    # Add resources to the API\n    api.add_resource(Todo, '/todo/<int:todo_id>')\n    \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app.run(debug=True)\n    \n    \n    * resources.py:\n    \n    from flask_restful import Resource, reqparse\n    \n    # Mocked data\n    TODOS = {\n        1: {'task': 'Build an API'},\n        2: {'task': '?????'},\n        3: {'task': 'Profit!'},\n    }\n    \n    # Define the Todo resource\n    class Todo(Resource):\n        def get(self, todo_id):\n            return TODOS[todo_id]\n    \n        def put(self, todo_id):\n            parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n            parser.add_argument('task')\n            args = parser.parse_args()\n            TODOS[todo_id] = {'task': args['task']}\n            return TODOS[todo_id], 200\n    \n        def delete(self, todo_id):\n            del TODOS[todo_id]\n            return '', 204\n    \n\n\nCOMMON REST VERBS\n\nGET\n\n * Purpose: Retrieve data.\n * Flask: Uses the @app.route decorator or, ideally, the flask-restful.Resource\n   with the method get.\n\nPOST\n\n * Purpose: Create a new instance of a resource.\n * Flask: Employ @app.route or better, flask-restful.Resource with the method\n   post.\n\nPUT\n\n * Purpose: Update an existing resource.\n * Flask: Requires using @app.route or the flask-restful.Resource with method\n   put.\n\nDELETE\n\n * Purpose: Remove a resource.\n * Flask: Accomplished using @app.route or the flask-restful.Resource with\n   method delete.\n\nPATCH (AND OTHERS)\n\n * Purpose: Update data with reduced payloads or perform custom operations.\n * Flask: You can use @app.route with PATCH, although the method should be\n   established with app.add_url_rule. Alternatively, flask-restful.Resource is\n   action-friendly methods that you can customize.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS OF @APP.ROUTE\n\nWhile utilizing @app.route for your HTTP verbs is a traditional technique, it's\nless maintainable for large or expanding APIs.

For example, the literal \"python\" matches\n   the string \"python\".\n\n * Character Classes: These match specific sets of characters. Examples include\n   \\d for digits, \\w for words, and \\s for whitespace.\n\n * Alternation: Represented by |, this constructs multiple options, matching any\n   of them.\n\n * Grouping: By using parenthesis ( and ), you can treat multiple items as a\n   single unit.\n\n * Repetition: Indicate the number of times a specific item should repeat, such\n   as * for zero or more times.\n\n * Anchors: Determine the position within a string. The most common ones are ^\n   for the start of the string and $ for the end.\n\n * Quantifiers: Specify how many times a specific component should appear, for\n   example ? for zero or one, and {3,5} for a specific range.\n\n * Look-Around: Allows for conditional matching based on the presence or absence\n   of another pattern.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nConsider a common use-case of extracting email addresses from a text. The\nfollowing regular expression can achieve that:\n\n\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b\n\n\nThis pattern **algorithmsstartswith literal characters \"bob\" , followed by one\nor more spaces (captured by the 'whitespace' character class \\s+), and ends with\nthe literal characters \"jones\". The use of the word-boundary assertions (\\b)\nensures that \"bob\" and \"jones\" are standalone words in the larger text.\n\n\nREGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN PYTHON\n\nIn Python, the re module provides support for regular expressions. Here is a\nbasic example:\n\nimport re\n\npattern = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\ntext = \"Contact us at hello@example.com or at support@mycompany.com\"\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\nfor match in matches:\n    print(match)\n","index":80,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"82.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU COMPILE A REGULAR EXPRESSION IN PYTHON?","answer":"In Python, you can compile regular expressions using the re.compile method.

This is especially useful in scenarios with a significant class imbalance to\n    avoid biased performance estimates.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STRATIFIED K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\n# Load Iris dataset\ndata = load_iris()\nX, y = data.data, data.target\n\n# Initialize Decision Tree Classifier\nmodel = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n\n# Perform Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation\nstrat_kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\ncv_results = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=strat_kfold, scoring='accuracy')\n\n# Display cross-validation results\nprint(f\"Cross-validated accuracies: {cv_results}\")\nprint(f\"Mean accuracy: {np.mean(cv_results)}\")\n","index":97,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"99.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SAVE A TRAINED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WITH PYTHON?","answer":"In Python, you can save a trained machine learning model to preserve its state\nand use it for future predictions.\n\nFor Scikit-learn models, you can use the joblib library, while Keras and\nTensorFlow models can be saved using built-in functions.\n\n\nSAVE/LOAD METHODS FOR COMMON LIBRARIES\n\n * Scikit-learn: Uses joblib (an extended version of pickle-to-disk to preserve\n   large variables)\n * Keras: Provides .save() and tf.keras.models.load_model()\n * LightGBM/XGBoost: Utilizes booster.save_model() and booster.load_model()\n   methods\n * PyTorch: Offers torch.save() and torch.load() for saving and loading model\n   state\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SAVING AN SKLEARN MODEL\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nimport joblib\n\n# Train the model\nX, y = ...  # Input and target data\nmodel = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)\n\n# Save the model to a file\njoblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')\n\n# Load the model from the file\nloaded_model = joblib.load('model.pkl')\n\n# Use the loaded model for predictions\nresult = loaded_model.predict(X_new)\n\n\nIn this code:\n\n * The LogisticRegression model is trained on the input X and target y.\n * It is then saved to a file named 'model.pkl' using joblib.dump().\n * The saved model is loaded back using joblib.load().\n * Finally, the loaded model is used to make predictions on new data, X_new.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SAVING A KERAS MODEL\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate sample data\nX, y = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)\n\n# Build the Keras model\nmodel = Sequential([\n    Dense(1, input_shape=(10,), activation='sigmoid')\n])\nmodel.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='binary_crossentropy')\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X, y, epochs=10)\n\n# Save the model\nmodel.save('keras_model.h5')\n\n# Load the model\nloaded_model = Sequential()\nloaded_model = loaded_model.load('keras_model.h5')\n\n# Use the loaded model\npredictions = loaded_model.predict(X)\n\n\nIn this example, the Keras model is a simple neural network with a single output\nneuron and a sigmoid activation function, optimized using stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for binary classification.\n\nThe model is trained on the generated data (X, y) and then saved to a file named\nkeras_model.h5 using the .save() method.","index":98,"topic":" Python ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"100.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE STEPS INVOLVED IN TRAINING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WITH PYTHON?","answer":"Here are the steps to train a machine learning model using Python:\n\n 1.
