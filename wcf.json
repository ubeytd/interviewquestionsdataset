It enables you to build secure and\nreliable web services for inter-process communication within and across systems.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n 1. Service Contract: Defines what operations a service can perform.\n 2. Data Contract: Defines the types of data that will be exchanged.\n 3. Message Contract: Provides control over the SOAP header.\n 4. Fault Contract: Specifies errors raised by the service.\n 5. Service Host: Enables hosting the service in various environments like IIS,\n    Console, or Windows Service.\n\n\nWCF COMMUNICATION STACK\n\nWCF has an extensible architecture, with three core components:\n\n 1. Transport Layer: Handles physical communication like TCP/IP, HTTP, and MSMQ.\n 2. Message Encoder: Converts messages to and from the wire format.\n 3. Protocols: Implements SOAP standards.\n\n\nWCF HOSTING OPTIONS\n\n 1. IIS Hosting: The service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS).\n 2. Self-Hosting: The service is hosted in a separate process, like a Windows\n    Service or Console Application. This method is useful for development and\n    testing.\n 3. Windows Service Hosting: The service is hosted in a Windows Service for\n    long-running tasks or background processing.\n\n\nTHREE MAIN COMMUNICATION STYLES\n\n 1. One-Way Communication: Send operations without expecting a return message.\n 2. Duplex Communication: Establish bi-directional communication channels.\n 3. Request-Reply Communication: Standard client-server model with request and\n    response.\n\n\nCONFIGURATIONS MODES\n\n 1. Imperative: You configure services and clients in code.\n 2. Declarative: Settings are defined in an XML file. This is a preferred\n    approach as it separates configuration from code, offering more flexibility.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF WEB SERVICES\n\nFor building and consuming web services in WCF, Visual Studio uses two primary\nproject templates:\n\n 1. WCF Service Application: This is used to host services within IIS.\n 2. WCF Service Library: This is used to define services without hosting, making\n    it suitable for unit tests and debugging.\n\n\nFLOW OF OPERATION\n\n 1. Service Model: Configurations like defining endpoints, contracts, and\n    behaviors.\n 2. Transport: Manages client-to-server communication, with the ability to add\n    custom behaviors.\n 3. Security: Enforces various security options like encryption, authentication,\n    and authorization.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n * Extensibility: WCF is designed to allow for different types of extensions,\n   such as transport and message encoders.\n * Interoperability: It supports different protocols, ensuring communication\n   between different platforms.\n * Flexibility: It's highly adaptable to specific project needs.\n * Versioning: Provides mechanisms for upgrading and maintaining old service\n   versions.\n * Fault Tolerance: WCF supports retry behaviors and offers fault contracts for\n   better error handling.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WCF SERVICE CONTRACT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    List<string> GetNames();\n\n    [OperationContract]\n    void AddName(string name);\n}\n","index":0,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nHOW IS WCF DIFFERENT FROM ASP.NET WEB SERVICES?","answer":"Both Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and ASP.NET Web Services provide the\nmeans for applications to communicate with each other using web standards.\nHowever, they differ in various aspects.\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\nFLEXIBILITY\n\n * WCF: Offers a higher degree of flexibility, enabling you to define more\n   intricate communication patterns.\n * ASP.NET Web Services: Primarily supports simpler, standardized methods such\n   as SOAP-based services.\n\nHOSTING OPTIONS\n\n * WCF: Ensures extensive flexibility in hosting options, supporting\n   self-hosting and hosting in custom environments.\n * ASP.NET Web Services: Typically are hosted within the IIS web server.\n\nTRANSPORT SUPPORT\n\n * WCF: Designed to work across various transports, be it HTTP, TCP, or named\n   pipes.\n * ASP.NET Web Services: Traditionally are best suited for HTTP but can be\n   extended to support other transports.\n\nMULTIPURPOSE COMMUNICATION\n\n * WCF: Equipped for both cross-network and cross-process communication, making\n   it suitable for a broader range of applications.\n * ASP.NET Web Services: More tailored for network applications and web service\n   interoperability.","index":1,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF WCF?","answer":"WCF (Windows Communication Foundation), part of the .NET framework, acts as a\nunified and service-oriented communication platform.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES OF WCF\n\n 1.

In SOA, services are independently deployable, self-contained, and\ninclude both data and functionality.\n\nKEY FEATURES OF SERVICE ORIENTATION\n\n * Autonomy: Services are responsible for managing their own state and\n   resources, reducing interdependence among components.\n\n * Discoverability: Services need to broadcast what functionalities they offer,\n   typically through well-defined and discoverable interfaces.\n\n * Contract-Driven Development: Service interactions are governed by clearly\n   defined contracts, promoting interoperability and loose-coupling among\n   systems.\n\n * Statelessness and Idempotence: Services should be designed to function\n   without relying on the previous state or producing an impact multiple times\n   under the same set of input parameters.\n\n * Conversationality: It's about supporting long-running, multi-message\n   interactions between clients and services.\n\n * Persistence: The way services maintain and manage data and state.\n\n * Distribution and Location Transparency: The end-user or calling component\n   might not necessarily understand the physical location or distribution method\n   of the service.\n\n * Liveness Awareness. A service might need to dynamically discover other\n   services, for example.\n\n * Coordination and Transactional Behavior: It might be necessary to ensure that\n   certain actions or sequences of steps across multiple services always happen\n   together or not at all.\n\n * Reliability: Services need to ensure consistent behaviors and reliable\n   delivery of data and messages.\n\n * Monitoring: This involves providing mechanisms for tracking the health and\n   other relevant metrics of services.","index":3,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nWHAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT IN WCF?","answer":"In the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), a service contract is an\nessential component that defines the operations the service can perform. It\nserves as a contract, ensuring that both the service and its clients adhere to\nthe same set of operations and data exchange standards.\n\n\nCORE ELEMENTS OF A SERVICE CONTRACT\n\nA service contract is defined by four key components:\n\n 1. Service Interface: This specifies the methods or operations that the service\n    provides for both request-reply and one-way communication patterns.\n\n 2. Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs): A service contract can define different\n    message exchange patterns, including the traditional Request-Reply pattern\n    and more streamlined One-Way patterns.\n\n 3. Message Schemas: These are defined using XML Schema and specify the\n    structure of messages being sent and received.\n\n 4. DataContract Attributes: These provide additional control over data types\n    that are exchanged in WCF operations.\n\n\nSERVICE CONTRACT EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nusing System.ServiceModel;\n\n// Define a service contract with specific operations and their message exchange patterns\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyService \n{\n    // Define a request-reply operation\n    [OperationContract]\n    string GetData(int value);\n\n    // Define one-way operation\n    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\n    void ProcessData(DataObject data);\n}\n\n// Define a data contract that describes the structure of exchanged data\n[DataContract]\npublic class DataObject\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    [DataMember]\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * IMyService is the service contract that declares two operations. The GetData\n   method uses a request-reply pattern, and ProcessData uses a one-way pattern.\n * DataObject is the data contract that defines a structured data format used in\n   the ProcessData method.\n\n\nCODE BREAKDOWN\n\n * The IExtensibleDataObject interface is an optional contract that extends data\n   serialization capabilities. It is used to store the data that is not part of\n   the data contract.\n\n * The ServiceContract attribute marks the interface or the class (containing\n   the methods) as a service contract. It supports properties like Namespace,\n   Name, ConfigurationNamespace, and ProtectionLevel.\n\n * The DataContract attribute marks a class to be included in data contracts for\n   serialization and deserialization processes. It includes properties and\n   fields. You can further control the individual members using the DataMember\n   attribute. Its properties include Name, IsRequired, EmitDefaultValue, Order,\n   and ProtectionLevel.\n\n * The OperationContract attribute marks methods within a service contract as\n   operations. It includes properties like Name, Action, AsyncPattern, IsOneWay,\n   and ProtectionLevel.\n   \n   * Actions specify the SOAP action for each operation. If not specified, WCF\n     chooses an action based on other features of the message, allowing the same\n     contract-based service to respond to multiple action values.\n\nTip: Always annotate your contracts and data contracts with precise metadata to\nensure consistent behavior across WCF services and clients.","index":4,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nDEFINE A DATA CONTRACT IN WCF.","answer":"A data contract in WCF is an interoperable agreement that bridges communication\ngaps between different systems.

Depending on the configuration,\n   some members may be optional or mandatory in a message.\n\n * Metadata: WCF utilizes metadata to ensure consistency in data processing\n   across communicating systems.\n\n * Sharing Rules: Data contracts allow you to specify global or service-specific\n   sharing rules that dictate which data types are 'visible' to particular\n   services.\n\n * Version Identifiers: A data contract can incorporate versioning directives to\n   manage changes in the data layout over time.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DATA CONTRACT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[DataContract]\npublic class EmployeeData\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    public int EmployeeID { get; set; }\n\n    [DataMember]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    [DataMember]\n    public DateTime JoiningDate { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nIn this example:\n\n * [DataContract] decorates the class EmployeeData to indicate that it serves as\n   a WCF data contract.\n * Each public member (property in this case) of the class that needs to be\n   included in the contract is adorned with [DataMember].","index":5,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE ABCS OF WCF?","answer":"Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) provides a unified programming model for\nbuilding efficient, secure, and interoperable distributed applications.

This ensures that data remains secure in transit.\n\n\nAUTHORIZATION\n\nWCF validates access rights based on the identity of the client. You can\nestablish authorization rules at the operation and resource levels, leveraging\nrole-based permissions.\n\n\nSERVICE NON-REPUDIATION\n\nTo prevent services from denying performing an operation, WCF uses service\nnon-repudiation, ensuring data integrity. This mechanism requires services to\nsign messages, using, for instance, WS-Security.\n\n\nMESSAGE INTEGRITY\n\nWCF verifies that the data in the message hasn't been tampered with by using\ndigital signatures. The message-level integrity check ensures that both the\nsender and the receiver can trust the message.\n\n\nFIREWALLS AND PORT CONFIGURATIONS\n\nFor enhanced network security, WCF is designed to be firewall-friendly.

This process happens\n   automatically via built-in \"enlistment\" interfaces.\n\nIn this case, if any enlisted resource experiences a failure or violates\ntransactional semantics, the entire transaction can be rolled back.\n\n\nTRANSACTION CONFIGURATION IN WCF\n\nYou can fine-tune transaction behavior via service and endpoint configurations\nwithin the web.config or app.config files.\n\n<system.serviceModel> Section and Its Child Elements: You can define various\ntransaction attributes at this section level to establish global transactional\nbehavior for the service.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n<system.serviceModel>\n    <services>\n        <service name=\"YourService\">\n            <behaviorConfiguration=\"TransactionBehavior\">\n        </service>\n    </services>\n\n    <behaviors>\n        <serviceBehaviors>\n            <behavior name=\"TransactionBehavior\">\n                <ServiceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"true\" httpGetUrl=\"\" />\n                <ServiceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"true\" />\n                <serviceTransactions transactionTimeout=\"00:15:00\" />\n            </behavior>\n        </serviceBehaviors>\n    </behaviors>\n</system.serviceModel>\n\n\n * TransactionFlow: Controlled via the TransactionFlow attribute, it specifies\n   how transactional data propagates between client and server.\n\n * Transaction Protocols: WCF supports multiple protocols like\n   WS-AtomicTransaction and OleTransactions, detailed via transactions\n   attribute.\n\nElements: The binding elements define low-level properties governing\ntransactional behaviors.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n<bindings>\n    <wsHttpBinding>\n        <binding name=\"WSHTTPBindingWithTS\">\n            <security mode=\"TransportWithMessageCredential\" />\n            <transactionFlow transactionProtocol=\"WSAtomicTransactionOctober2004\" />\n        </binding>\n    </wsHttpBinding>\n</bindings>\n\n\n\nDTC AND TRANSACTION FLOW\n\nWhen DTC is active, WCF can be more flexible in managing distributed\ntransactional workflows. For this to work, configurations, as well as firewall\nsettings, must allow for DTC management across involved entities.\n\nThe service model configuration also provides settings to determine how a\ntransaction flow and participation is handled with respect to both custom and\nvaried bindings.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WCF SERVICE WITH TRANSACTION SUPPORT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic interface IMyService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    [TransactionFlow(TransactionFlowOption.Mandatory)]\n    string GetData(int value);\n}\n\npublic class MyService : IMyService\n{\n    [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true, TransactionAutoComplete = true)]\n    public string GetData(int value)\n    {\n        // Perform data operations within a transaction scope using System.Transactions.TransactionScope\n    }\n}\n","index":47,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"49.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTIONFLOW ATTRIBUTE?","answer":"TransactionFlow is an essential mechanism in WCF for governing transactions\nbetween a client and a service.\n\nWHY USE TRANSACTIONFLOW\n\nIt's often crucial for a service to enlist ongoing operations in a long-running,\nmulti-step transaction, ensuring consistency and atomicity.

Service Contract:\n    \n    Mark the contract with IsOneWay as false to indicate non-void return types\n    and IsRequired as true to mandate participation in a transaction.\n    \n    [ServiceContract]\n    public interface IMyService\n    {\n        [OperationContract(IsRequired = true)]\n        string MyMethod();\n    }\n    \n\n 2. Service Behavior:\n    \n    * Use the TransactionScope service behavior to ensure the transactional\n      communication.\n    \n    * Add the following to the service configuration:\n      \n      <serviceBehaviors>\n         <behavior name=\"TransactionScope\">\n            <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"true\" />\n            <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"false\" />\n            <transactionFlow transactionOptions=\"Allowed\" />\n         </behavior>\n      </serviceBehaviors>\n      \n    \n    * Link the behavior to the service by specifying the behaviorConfiguration\n      attribute inside the service tag:\n      \n      <service name=\"YourNamespace.YourService\" behaviorConfiguration=\"TransactionScope\">\n      \n\n 3. Client-Side Considerations:\n    \n    * The client needs to propagate the transaction context. You can achieve\n      this either by using an OperationContextScope (available in WCF clients)\n      or by creating a TransactionScope and setting its Option property to\n      TransactionScopeOption.Required.\n    \n    * Make sure to close the TransactionScope when it's no longer needed,\n      typically inside a try-finally block.\n\nNote: If you're using an explicit transaction, ensure that all resources\nenlisted in the transaction, including the WCF service, support the same type of\ntransaction (for example, a committable transaction).

This is useful in scenarios where the\n   server needs to provide regular or timely updates to the client throughout\n   the life of a session.\n\n * Callbacks: The mechanism is often referred to as \"callbacks\" as it involves\n   the server invoking specific methods, or callbacks, on the client. Callback\n   contracts define these methods, and each client instance provides an\n   implementation.\n\n * WCF Duplex Channel: Internally, WCF uses a dedicated channel, known as the\n   DuplexChannel, to manage and facilitate bidirectional communication.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DEFINE CALLBACK CONTRACT\n\nHere is the code:\n\n 1. Locate the Service Contract: You define your service contract, and the\n    associated callback contract in C#:\n    \n    [ServiceContract]  \n    public interface IMyContract  \n    {  \n        [OperationContract]  \n        void MyMethod();  \n    }  \n    \n    public interface IMyContractCallback  \n    {  \n        [OperationContract]  \n        void OnCallback();  \n    }\n    \n\n 2. Specify Callback Methods: The callback methods are defined in the\n    IMyContractCallback contract. You can attribute these methods as\n    [OperationContract] if you want a more structured, WCF-based approach to the\n    callback mechanism.\n\n 3. Acknowledge Callback Behavior: To determine when to invoke the callback, use\n    [ServiceBehavior] and set the UseSynchronizationContext to true or false as\n    needed:\n    \n    [ServiceBehavior(  \n    UseSynchronizationContext = true/false  \n    CallbackInstanceContextMode = CallbackInstanceContextMode.PerSession/PerCall/Single)]\n    \n    public class MyService : IMyContract  \n    {  \n        public void MyMethod()  \n        {  \n            IMyContractCallback callback = OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel<IMyContractCallback>();  \n            // Some additional action might be required before or after the callback  \n            // ...  \n        }  \n    }\n    \n\nIn the code, the OperationContext class is used to obtain the callback instance\nassociated with the specific client making the original request.\n\nThese mechanisms, such as UseSynchronizationContext, help in thread safety and\ncontext management.

Addressing: Resolves the service's base address to create an endpoint\n    address.\n\n 2. Creation and Activation of the Service Instance: Instantiates the service\n    class and manages its lifecycle.\n\n 3. Hosting service runtime: Hosts all the necessary components to manage the\n    service endpoints, such as dispatchers and message filters.\n\n 4. Managing Endpoints: Controls the availability of endpoints for incoming\n    requests.\n\n 5. Thread Management: Ensures incoming service requests are handled on the\n    appropriate threads.\n\n\nSERVICEHOST LIFECYCLE\n\nThe ServiceHost goes through several states from instantiation to eventual\ndisposal:\n\n 1. Created: A new ServiceHost is created and is ready for configuration.\n\n 2. Opening: The ServiceHost initializes all the endpoints and channels. After\n    this, the endpoint listeners start processing incoming messages.\n\n 3. Opened: The ServiceHost is ready to accept incoming service requests, and it\n    transitions to this state when all the endpoints open successfully.\n\n 4. Closing: Initiates the closing of endpoints and channels. From this point,\n    the ServiceHost won't accept new requests.\n\n 5. Closed: All channels and endpoints associated with the ServiceHost are\n    closed. The ServiceHost moves to this state when all the endpoints are\n    closed successfully.\n\n 6. Faulted: If an error occurs that causes the ServiceHost or any of its\n    endpoints to fault, they enter this state.\n\n\nHOSTING MODES\n\nWCF supports several hosting methods, each suited to different application types\nand maintenance requirements:\n\n 1. Self-Hosting: The simplest method, where the service runs in a console\n    application or WinForms application. However, these services will be less\n    manageable, as they need to be manually started and stopped, generally\n    speaking.\n\n 2. IIS Hosting: Here, the service utilises Windows Process Activation Service\n    (WAS) to host. This method is appropriate for web applications and provides\n    more management features, such as automatic start and stop of services,\n    health monitoring and process recycling.\n\n 3. Windows Service Hosting: Employing Windows Services as a hosting mechanism\n    provides greater reliability and manageability. Windows services always run\n    in the background and can be configured to start automatically with the\n    system.\n\n 4.

To\nemploy ServiceHostBase Behaviors, one must customize a ServiceHost instance. The\nIServiceBehavior interface represents these extensions.\n\nYou can use these behavior extension points to change how ServiceHostBase\nobjects behave before, during, or after hosting WCF services.\n\nCHANNELFACTORY AND CHANNELLISTENER BEHAVIORS\n\nFor client-side communication, ChannelFactory and ChannelListener objects are in\ncharge of creating and managing channels.\n\nDistinct behaviors can be associated with each endpoint. To use these, you\nassociate behaviors during the setup of the client endpoint.\n\nCUSTOM SERVICEHOSTFACTORY AND CHANNELFACTORY\n\nBy developing customized factories, you can cater to specialized hosting or\ncommunication requirements. This method is especially useful for scenarios not\ncovered by generic factories.\n\n\nWCF FEATURES WITH BUILT-IN BEHAVIORS\n\nWCF offers several such features, which can already be customized using\nbehaviors.\n\nCLIENT-SIDE CONFIGURATION TERMINATIONS\n\n * Outgoing Message Encrypting: Set establishSecurityContext to false and\n   specify a certificate for message security.\n * Outgoing Message Signing: Enable message security and specify a certificate\n   for message signing.\n * Session Mode: Configure the sessionMode attribute.\n * Security Settings: Adjust security settings for message level or transport\n   level security.\n\nCONCURRENT CALLS\n\n * Per-Call Services: Identical to default settings.\n * Per-Session Services: Set the ConcurencyMode to single or multiple.\n * Single Instance Services: Modify InstanceContextMode and set ConcurrencyMode\n   to single.\n\n\nCUSTOM VALIDATION AND AUTHORIZATION\n\nYou can develop your custom validators and authorization alright handlers.\n\n * Validators: Implement ICustomValidator and define the method to validate the\n   message.\n * Authorization Handlers: Create a class that implements IAuthorizationPolicy,\n   and manage authorization policies for your service.\n\n\nEXTENDING WCF SERVICES USING CONFIGURATIONS\n\nUse behavior configurations, operation configurations, and endpoint\nconfigurations to extend WCF services.\n\nBEHAVIOR CONFIGURATIONS\n\nBe sure to place the behavior element in the WCF configuration file, and then\nassert the attribute name with the behavior name.\n\nWhile creating services, hosting objects such as ServiceHost or ChannelFactory\nshould refer to the said behaviors.\n\nENDPOINT CONFIGURATIONS\n\nYou can configure typical elements for an endpoint through the endpoint\nbehaviors.\n\nFor example:\n\n<behaviors>\n    <endpointBehaviors>\n        <behavior name=\"securedEndpoint\">\n            <clientCredentials>\n                <clientCertificate certificate=\"\" />\n            </clientCredentials>\n        </behavior>\n    </endpointBehaviors>\n</behaviors>\n\n<extensions>\n  <behaviorExtensions>\n      <add name=\"customBehavior\" type=\"YourApp.Namespace, YourAssembly\" />\n   </behaviorExtensions>\n</extensions>\n\n<client>\n    <endpoint \n        address=\"...\"\n        behaviorConfiguration=\"securedEndpoint\"/>\n</client>\n\n\n\nOPERATION CONFIGURATIONS\n\nA key benefit of WCF is how readily it injects behaviors. Operation behaviors\nfocus on precise operations within the service. Incorporating them can\nsignificantly fine-tune your WCF service's functionality. For example, custom\noperation behaviors let you build task-specific behaviors for individual\noperations in service contracts.\n\nFor the finest control over how your service behaves, ensure that operation\nparameters, such as endpoint address, are set according to your operational\nrequirements. The service should efficiently serve its purpose, attuned to your\nexact specifications.","index":65,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"67.\n\n\nWHAT ARE DISPATCHERS AND CHANNELS IN WCF?","answer":"In WCF, a channel represents the messaging layer. It handles the serialization\nand deserialization of messages, as well as their transmission and the life\ncycle of the network connection.\n\nWCF uses dispatchers to route incoming messages to the specified service\nendpoints. They play a crucial role in request handling and provide the bridge\nbetween the transport protocol and the WCF runtime.\n\n\nDISPATCHERS\n\n * Input & Output: WCF has both client-side and server-side dispatchers. The\n   server-side dispatchers are classified into Endpoint, instance context,\n   synchronization context, and operations.\n\n * Lifecycle Management: Dispatchers handle the lifecycle of service instances,\n   ensuring that each message is routed to the relevant service endpoint.\n   \n   For instance, if the PerSession mode is applied, the dispatchers would route\n   messages to the same service instance throughout a session.\n\nFUNDAMENTAL CLASSES\n\nWCF dispatchers are implemented through classes such as the following:\n\n * ChannelDispatcher: determines which service a message should be routed to,\n   manages service instance creation and shutdown, and invokes message handlers.\n * InstanceContextSynchronization: ensures that the InstanceContext object is\n   used by only one thread at a time.\n * SyncrhonizationContext: ensures that the message arrives on the correct\n   thread or context using a synchronization context object.\n\n\nCHANNELS\n\nWCF channels form the communication layer between the client and the server.\nThey are used to transfer messages across various communication protocols, such\nas HTTP, TCP, or custom bindings.\n\n * Types: WCF features several types of channels, each serving a distinct\n   purpose. Common channel types include the transport, message encoder, and the\n   message itself. Examples of these channels are the RequestReplyChannel,\n   TransportChannel, and Message.\n\n * Pipeline: Channels work in a pipeline fashion, where each channel has the\n   opportunity to modify or inspect the message before and after transmission.\n\n * Responsibilities: Each channel is responsible for distinct tasks, such as\n   message framing, encoding, or transport. Cumulatively, the channels in a\n   channel stack perform a range of activities necessary for effective\n   communication.\n\nWCF CHANNEL STACK\n\nThe channel stack acts as a procession line for the message, with each channel\nhaving a specific role before the finalized message is sent or received.\nChannels are often grouped and managed using channel managers.\n\n * Channel Stack Positioning: Channels are arranged in a specific order within\n   the channel stack to ensure that message transmission occurs smoothly and\n   efficiently.\n\n * Channel Stack Creation: The typical approach in WCF is to create a channel\n   stack as a one-way operation or ensure that the stack is duplex to enable\n   both one-way and two-way communication.","index":66,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"68.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU CREATE CUSTOM BINDINGS IN WCF?","answer":"Let me show you step-by-step how to create custom WCF bindings.

Expose it as a WCF service:\n\n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://tempuri.org\")]\npublic interface IOrderWorkflow\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    void ProcessOrder(Order order);\n}\n\n[ServiceBehavior(Name=\"OrderWorkflow\", Namespace=\"http://tempuri.org\")]\npublic class OrderWorkflow: IOrderWorkflow\n{\n    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)\n    {\n        // Start a new Order Workflow for the given order\n        IDictionary<String, object> input = new Dictionary<String, Object>();\n        input.Add(\"Order\", order);\n        \n        WorkflowServiceHost host = new WorkflowServiceHost(new OrderWorkflow(), new Uri(\"http://localhost:8123/OrderWorkflow\"));\n        \n        WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior unhandledBehavior = new WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior { Name = \"Unhandled Exception in the Order Workflow\" };\n        host.Description.Behaviors.Add(unhandledBehavior);\n        WorkflowHostingResponseContext response = host.OpenAsync().Result;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, IOrderWorkflow is a service contract that the WF workflow\nimplements, and OrderWorkflow is the actual WCF service that runs as a host for\nthe workflow. When the WCF service receives an order, it starts a new instance\nof the OrderWorkflow by supplying the order details as input.\n\nThe workflow will then progress through its stages, interacting with the\ncustomer ordering system.\n\nFor example, let's say the workflow is designed to trigger an approval process\nif the order amount exceeds a certain threshold. The WCF service will handle\nmechanisms to communicate that to the order workflow, via WCF Send and Reply\nactivities.","index":70,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"72.\n\n\nCAN YOU EXPOSE A WF AS A WCF SERVICE?","answer":"Yes, you can expose a Windows Workflow as a WCF service. This capability aligns\nwith the interoperability goals of WCF, allowing it to flexibly interface with\ndiverse systems and technologies.\n\n\nOFFERING WORKFLOW AS A SERVICE\n\n * ServiceContract: When defining your WCF service, mark it with a\n   ServiceContract attribute. This step aligns the service with Windows Workflow\n   and indicates that it's intended to be hosted in WCF.\n\n * OperationContract: Use OperationContract attributes to indicate which\n   Workflow methods correspond to service operations.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SERVICECONTRACT AND OPERATIONCONTRACT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyWorkflowService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    void StartMyWorkflow();\n}\n\n\nThe method StartMyWorkflow() can point to a method within your WF that triggers\nthe workflow's commencement.\n\nIf you're working with UI-related workflows, use SynchronizationMode to ensure\nthe response is synchronized with the original call.\n\n\nHOSTING WCF SERVICES\n\nThere are several ways to host:\n\nIIS HOSTING\n\n * Situational Use: Suited for making services publicly available on the\n   internet or private intranet.\n * Workflow Configuration: Configure the <add> element within the\n   <serviceActivations> section in the service's web.config file. Also remember\n   to have the system.serviceModel <serviceHostingEnvironment> attribute set to\n   \"workflowService\".\n\nSELF-HOSTING\n\nSelf-hosting is suitable for non-web applications like console applications or\nWindows Services.\n\n * Workflow Configuration: Use a WorkflowServiceHost in conjunction with your\n   workflow definition.\n * Role of WorkflowServiceHost: This specialized host allows integrated hosting\n   of WF and WCF capabilities.\n\nWINDOWS ACTIVATION SERVICE (WAS) HOSTING\n\nAlso known as Process Activation Service (PAS), WAS comes into play for hosting\nWCF Workflow Services. WAS couples the web server (such as IIS 7.0) with\nserver-side applications.\n\n * Workflow Configuration: Just as in IIS hosting, configure the <add> element\n   within the <serviceActivations> section in the service's web.config file.\n   Remember to set the system.serviceModel <serviceHostingEnvironment> to\n   \"workflowService\".\n\nIn all these hosting scenarios, the WF service coexists with the more\ntraditional WCF services, permitting a diverse range of service types within one\nenvironment.\n\n\nMANAGING WORKFLOW STATE\n\n * Persistence: For long-running workflows, it is crucial to persist or keep\n   them in a \"dormant\" state between invocations. WCF, with its ability to host\n   workflows, naturally supports this requirement. Its persistence model helps\n   store the essential context until the workflow is ready for further\n   processing.\n\n * Data Exchange: The interplay between your WCF service and hosted workflow can\n   also involve data exchange. From invoking the workflow, tracking its\n   progress, to ultimately receiving its end result—all can be managed via this\n   data interaction mechanism.","index":71,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"73.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE LONG-RUNNING PROCESSES IN WCF?","answer":"Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) supports long-running operations through\nasynchronous patterns, duplex channels, and specialized queues.\n\n\nONE-WAY OPERATIONS\n\nFor fire-and-forget operations, mark the service operation with\n[OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)] attribute.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ONE-WAY OPERATION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyService\n{\n    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\n    void FireAndForgetOperation();\n}\n\n\n\nASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS\n\nWCF enables non-blocking operations with both the Begin/End pattern and .NET's\nTask-based asynchronous model.\n\nBEGIN/END PATTERN\n\n * Client invokes the BeginOperation method.\n * Service continues executing, and the client can poll using EndOperation to\n   check for completion.\n\nTASK-BASED ASYNCHRONOUS MODEL\n\n * Clients call an operation asynchronously, obtaining a Task object.\n * The Task can be awaited for completion or used with other Task-related\n   methods.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    Task<int> LongRunningOperationAsync(string input);\n}\n\n\n\nDUPLEX CHANNELS\n\nWCF uses duplex messaging for two-way communication between client and server.\nThis is especially suitable for client-initiated operations, such as callbacks.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DUPLEX CHANNEL\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyService\n{\n    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\n    void RegisterForUpdates();\n}\n\n\n\nQUEUE-BASED MESSAGING\n\nWCF provides the NetMsmqBinding, leveraging Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) for\nreliable and queued message delivery.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MSMQ QUEUE SERVICE\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyMsmqService\n{\n    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\n    void ProcessData(string data);\n}\n\n\nConfigure the service to use NetMsmqBinding and attributes for queuing behavior:\n\n// Service contract with queue behavior\n[ServiceContract]\n[DeliveryRequirements(QueuedDeliveryRequirementsMode = QueuedDeliveryRequirementsMode.Allowed)]\npublic interface IMyMsmqService\n{\n    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\n    void ProcessData(string data);\n}\n","index":72,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"74.\n\n\nEXPLAIN CORRELATION IN WCF AND WF SERVICES.","answer":"In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), correlation establishes a link\nbetween individual messages for workflows or conversational sets.\n\n\nCONTEXT AND EXAMPLES\n\nConsider a banking application where a user sends multiple deposit requests.\nCorrelation ensures that each response aligns with the corresponding request\nand, by extension, the user's context.\n\n * Loose Coupling: Correlation allows for decoupling between messages and their\n   relationships, promoting flexibility.\n * Workflow Association: A multi-step bank transfer falls under a unified\n   workflow, and correlation helps bind the separate steps.\n\n\nIN WCF AND WF\n\n * WCF Duplex Services: Let a service send messages back to the client without\n   needing separate request channels.\n * WF Workflows: Coordinates interactions between workflow services and\n   workflows.\n * WF Service Context: Facilitates communication between a client application\n   and a running workflow instance.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n * Correlation Set: It's a collection of keys and values that link two or more\n   messages.

An explicit class or\nconfiguration settings can direct WCF to use load balancing algorithms.\n\nMECHANISM-BASED OPTIMIZATION\n\nWCF's factory-based design allows it to select appropriate channels, transaction\nsupports, and endpoints. However, this approach can become intricate with\nmultiple services and endpoints.\n\nTo optimize for the given mechanism:\n\n 1. Reinstate Session Context: This is essential for long-running tasks but\n    tends to make load balancing less predictable.\n\n 2. Duplicable Services and Contracts: Use this state-adjustment mode to control\n    WCF behaviors, like session continuity restriction.\n\n 3.

It provides a structured,\nservice-centric approach to system design, delivering flexibility and\nindependence to various components.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS OF SOA\n\n * Service Contract: The descriptive interface for a service, outlining\n   operations and messages.\n * Data Contract: Specifies the format of data passed between client and\n   service.\n * Policy (Security and Governance rules)\n\n\nWCF CHANNELS AND BINDINGS IN SOA\n\n * Service Channel: The medium through which the client and service exchange\n   messages. WCF offers various predefined channels, such as IInputChannel and\n   IOutputChannel.\n * Channel Factory: This dynamic construct is a crucial part of WCF's\n   extensibility, allowing new channels to be created as needed. It is\n   responsible for creating and managing service-specific channels.\n * Channel Listener: This tool synchronizes the client and service through an\n   available communication channel.\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF USING WCF IN SOA\n\n * Protocol Independence: WCF can function over various protocols, such as HTTP,\n   TCP, and named pipes. This flexibility is crucial in SOA environments, where\n   services should be transport-agnostic.\n\n * Format Flexibility: WCF empowers services to process messages in differing\n   formats, like XML or JSON, catering to diverse client needs.\n\n * Security Features: WCF offers a robust suite of security features, from\n   consent-based communication to data encryption and integrity checks.\n\n\nWCF CONTRACT TYPES AND THEIR ROLE IN SOA\n\n * Service Contract: Though not a WCF-specific concept, the Service Contract in\n   WCF refers to the agreement between the client and the service about the\n   messages to be exchanged. It acts as a cohesive glue, aligning client and\n   service functionalities.\n\n * Data Contract: In the realms of WCF, a Data Contract assures both parties\n   that the shared data adheres to a specific structure. It simplifies shared\n   data management and reduces ambiguity.\n\n * Fault Contract: Missteps in service can disrupt operation, and the Fault\n   Contract helps streamline error communication across different components.\n\n\nBUILDING A BASIC SOA-COMPLIANT SOLUTION WITH WCF\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nWCF Contract:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface ICalculatorService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    int Add(int x, int y);\n}\n\n\nService Implementation:\n\npublic class CalculatorService : ICalculatorService\n{\n    public int Add(int x, int y)\n    {\n        return x + y;\n    }\n}\n\n\nCode to Host the Service:\n\nusing System;\nusing System.ServiceModel;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        using (ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService)))\n        {\n            host.Open();\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Service is running...\");\n            Console.ReadKey();\n            host.Close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nClient Code to Consume the Service:\n\nusing System;\nusing System.ServiceModel;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        ChannelFactory<ICalculatorService> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<ICalculatorService>(\"CalculatorServiceEndpoint\");\n        ICalculatorService proxy = channelFactory.CreateChannel();\n\n        int result = proxy.Add(3, 5);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Result: \" + result);\n\n        ((IClientChannel)proxy).Close();\n        channelFactory.Close();\n    }\n}\n\n\nService Configuration in App.config (you need to add a new App.config file and\nadjust project properties to use it):\n\n<system.serviceModel>\n  <services>\n    <service name=\"YourNamespace.CalculatorService\">\n      <endpoint address=\"\" binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" contract=\"YourNamespace.ICalculatorService\"/>\n      <host>\n        <baseAddresses>\n          <add baseAddress=\"http://localhost:8080/calculator\"/>\n        </baseAddresses>\n      </host>\n    </service>\n  </services>\n</system.serviceModel>\n","index":88,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"90.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE STATE MANAGEMENT IN A SCALED-OUT WCF SERVICE?","answer":"State Management in WCF services involves strategies for both maintaining and\ndistributing state across multiple servers.\n\n\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * Concurrency: Simultaneous Request handling\n * Persistence: Ensuring state durability, especially for long-running processes\n * Scalability & Fault Tolerance: Handling transitions among multiple service\n   instances\n\n\nMECHANISMS FOR STATE MANAGEMENT\n\n 1. Instance-Based Models:\n    \n    * Per-Call: Every request creates a new instance. No shared state. Best for\n      scalability.\n    * Per-Session: A client session maps to a service instance. Suitable for\n      state retention across multiple calls.\n    * Singleton: Single service instance that can handle concurrent calls.\n\n 2. Operation Context:\n    Used for state tracking within a session, the OperationContext class\n    provides access to message-specific data during the lifetime of an\n    operation. However, in load-balanced scenarios, shared state such as session\n    data might not be effectively distributed.\n\n 3. Data Caching and Context Management:\n    Employing a distributed caching system can enable state sharing across\n    service instances. For contextual data such as user authentication, utilize\n    managed contexts.\n\n 4. Endpoint and Service Behaviors:\n    WCF provides behaviors that enable specific state management\n    functionalities, such as CallbackBehavior, which allows for invoking client\n    code from the service.\n\n 5. Custom State Management:\n    Tailor state-handling mechanisms as per application requirements. This might\n    include persistent storage or specialized caching strategies.\n\n 6.

Adhering to best practices enhances modularity, extensibility, and\noverall performance.\n\n\nGENERAL BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Design for Interoperability: This is especially important for services\n   intended to be consumed by a variety of clients.\n * Keep Contracts Simple: Strive for minimalism and ensure contracts are\n   explicit and well-defined to avoid ambiguity and errors during service\n   interactions.\n * Version Contracts: If there is potential for future change, plan for\n   versioning using strategies such as schema definitions or explicit\n   versioning.\n\n\nHOST CONFIGURATION\n\n * Avoid Declaring Endpoints in Code: Use configuration files for endpoint\n   definitions, promoting separation of concerns.\n * Leverage Features for Configuration: Minimize explicit configuration by\n   taking advantage of features that provide default configuration. For example,\n   the ServiceModel section in the config file already sets up a number of\n   defaults. Use features where it makes sense.\n\n\nSERVICE CONTRACT BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Coarse-Grained Services: Encapsulate your service logic cohesively in\n   methods, favoring larger operations over many small ones for efficiency.\n * Use Only Data Types that are Serializable: Serializable data types enable\n   inter-process and network communication between different components and\n   applications.\n\n\nDATA CONTRACT BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Keep Data Contracts Explicit: Mark intended \"data transfer\" classes with the\n   DataContract attribute and their members with DataMember.\n * Avoid Circular References: To prevent infinite loops during serialization and\n   de-serialization, use surrogate key patterns or exclude fields that may lead\n   to circular references.\n * Avoid Version Tolerance and Namespace Changes: Aim to define data contracts\n   to be version-tolerant from the start. If you do later need to allow\n   permissive deserialization, this must be carefully managed to guard against\n   security vulnerabilities.\n\n\nEXCEPTION HANDLING BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Consider Fault Contracts: Use explicit fault contracts for known error\n   conditions, particularly when working with SOAP endpoints.\n * Use Fault Exceptions for Callbacks: When a callback contract is utilized, use\n   fault exceptions to signal exceptions to the client, as they propagate across\n   the callback channel.","index":90,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"92.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT A WCF SERVICE IS SECURE?","answer":"Ensuring security for your WCF service involves addressing different layers,\nsuch as transport-level security and message-level security, and implementing\nappropriate security mechanisms for each.\n\n\nWCF SECURITY LAYERS\n\n * Transport-Level Security: This encrypts message data during transmission.\n\n * Message-Level Security: This encrypts and signs message data to ensure\n   confidentiality and integrity.\n\n\nASPECTS OF WCF SECURITY\n\n * Authentication: Verifies the identity of clients.\n * Authorization: Determines if authenticated clients can access the service.\n * Confidentiality: Ensures data privacy during transmission.\n * Integrity: Validates data during transmission.\n * Non-Repudiation: Prevents senders from denying that they sent a message.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONFIGURING A WCF SERVICE FOR SECURITY\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\nSERVICE CONTRACT\n\nCreate a service contract:\n\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IMyService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    string MyMethod(string data);\n}\n\n\nIMPLEMENTING THE SERVICE CONTRACT\n\nImplement the service contract:\n\npublic class MyService : IMyService\n{\n    public string MyMethod(string data)\n    {\n        return \"Received: \" + data;\n    }\n}\n\n\nHOST THE SERVICE & CONFIGURE ENDPOINTS\n\nHost the service and configure different endpoints for TCP, HTTP, and HTTPs.\n\nusing System;\nusing System.ServiceModel;\nusing System.ServiceModel.Description;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        Uri baseAddress = new Uri(\"http://localhost:8000/MyService\");\n        ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(MyService), baseAddress);\n        \n        NetTcpBinding tcpBinding = new NetTcpBinding();\n        tcpBinding.Security.Mode = SecurityMode.Message;\n        httpBinding.Security.Message.ClientCredentialType = MessageCredentialType.Windows;\n        host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IMyService), tcpBinding, \"net.tcp://localhost:8523/MyService/tcp\");\n        \n        BasicHttpBinding httpBinding = new BasicHttpBinding();\n        httpBinding.Security.Mode = BasicHttpSecurityMode.Transport;\n        httpBinding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType = HttpClientCredentialType.None;\n        host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IMyService), httpBinding, \"http://localhost:8000/MyService/basicHttp\");\n        \n        BasicHttpsBinding httpsBinding = new BasicHttpsBinding();\n        httpsBinding.Security.Mode = BasicHttpsSecurityMode.Transport;\n        httpsBinding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType = HttpClientCredentialType.None;\n        host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IMyService), httpsBinding, \"https://localhost:8000/MyService\");\n\n        ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior() { HttpGetEnabled = true };\n        host.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);\n\n        host.Open();\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The host is running and listening on port 8000.\");\n        Console.ReadLine(); \n\n        host.Close();\n    }\n}\n\n\nThis example configures authentication and security for the TCP, HTTP, and HTTPs\nendpoints.

Here are the key dos and don'ts.\n\n\nCONFIGURATION BEST PRACTICES\n\n 1. Do Not Over-Configure: Using default settings whenever possible reduces\n    complexity and can often enhance performance. This is true for both the\n    client-side and server-side configuration.\n\n 2. Use Configuration Files for Flexibility: WCF supports external configuration\n    files for greater flexibility. Avoid hard-coding configurations whenever\n    possible.\n\n\nTHREADING\n\n 3. Carefully Set Concurrency Mode: Concurrent service operations can improve\n    throughput but might require you to handle multithreading concerns. Ensure\n    your service implementation is thread-safe.\n\n 4. Avoid Modifying ExecutionContext: Manually managing the ExecutionContext can\n    have unintended consequences, such as context mismanagement or resource\n    leaks. It's typically better to let WCF handle this.\n\n 5. Use Synchronization: If your service code involves shared resources or\n    state, ensure you synchronize access to these resources.\n    Over-synchronization, however, can lead to performance bottlenecks.\n\n 6. Prefer Sessionless Services: If your service doesn't explicitly require a\n    session, it might be preferable to disable sessions.\n\n\nHOSTING, ADDRESSING, AND BINDING\n\n 7.  Use Instance and Concurrency Modes Thoughtfully: Choose the most suitable\n     combination of service and instance behaviors to balance resource\n     utilization and throughput. For example, for high-volume, stateless\n     operations, set InstanceContextMode to PerCall and disable or limit the\n     number of concurrent calls.\n\n 8.  Evaluate Message Size and Buffer Settings: Oversized messages can lead to\n     increased latency, application slowdowns, or even service failures.\n\n 9.  Use Multiple Endpoints: Consider using multiple endpoints for the same\n     service contract to expose varying security requirements or protocols.\n\n 10. Consider Explicit Configuration: While WCF might offer intelligent defaults\n     in many scenarios, explicitly configuring key components—such as the\n     security mode and security details—ensures nothing is left to guesswork or\n     assumptions.\n\n 11. Limit Timeout: Avoid unbounded or overly generous timeouts, as that could\n     keep resources like connections or threads occupied longer than necessary.\n\n 12. Centralize Common Configuration Settings: To promote consistency in\n     environments with multiple services, consider centralizing common\n     configuration settings.\n\n\nSECURITY\n\n 13. Use Transport over Message Security: Match your security mode with the\n     transport mechanism for optimal security.\n\n 14. Prefer Transport-Level Security: Using transport-level security, like\n     SSL/TLS, better guarantees message confidentiality and integrity.\n\n 15. Use Certificates Judiciously: While certificates offer robust security,\n     avoid unnecessary overhead by striking a balance between security and\n     performance.\n\n\nERROR HANDLING\n\n 16. Implement Fault Contracts for Exception Details: When exceptions propagate\n     from a service to a client, they can be enhanced with structured fault\n     information using fault contracts.\n\n 17. Avoid Over-Exposing Service Details: For security and maintenance reasons,\n     avoid exposing implementation details.

Let me show you the key\nconcepts.\n\n\nCONCEPTS\n\n * Message Handlers: Implement custom message processing logic by creating\n   custom message inspectors or parameter inspectors.\n * Service Agent/Handler: Use a service agent to encapsulate and execute the\n   reusable logic.\n * Custom Behaviors: Define custom behaviors to address cross-cutting concerns,\n   such as security or validation.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MESSAGE INSPECTOR\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class CustomMessageInspector : IClientMessageInspector\n{\n    public object BeforeSendRequest(ref Message request, IClientChannel channel)\n    {\n        // Add custom logic before request is sent\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    public void AfterReceiveReply(ref Message reply, object correlationState)\n    {\n        // Add custom logic after receiving reply\n    }\n}\n\n\nHow It Works: These handlers intercept messages before or after they are sent or\nreceived.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SERVICE AGENT\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class DataService : IDataService\n{\n    private object reusableData;\n\n    public void ExecuteOperation()\n    {\n        // Reuse the logic here\n        this.reusableData = GetReusableData();\n    }\n\n    private object GetReusableData()\n    {\n        // Implement data retrieval logic here\n    }\n}\n\n\nHow It Works: Request-response design ensures that a single reusable service\ninstance handles multiple operations.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CUSTOM BEHAVIOR\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\npublic class CustomBehavior : IEndpointBehavior\n{\n    // Other interface methods\n\n    public void ApplyClientBehavior(ServiceEndpoint endpoint, ClientRuntime clientRuntime)\n    {\n        // Add custom logic for client behavior\n    }\n\n    public void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceDescription serviceDescription, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase)\n    {\n        // Apply the dispatcher to handle service side behavior\n        foreach (var operation in serviceDescription.Endpoints.SelectMany(ep => ep.Contract.Operations))\n        {\n            operation.Behaviors.Add(new CustomOperationBehavior());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CustomOperationBehavior : IOperationBehavior\n{\n    public void ApplyClientBehavior(OperationDescription operationDescription, ClientOperation clientOperation)\n    {\n        // Implement custom client behavior\n    }\n\n    public void ApplyDispatchBehavior(OperationDescription operationDescription, DispatchOperation dispatchOperation)\n    {\n        // Implement custom dispatch behavior\n    }\n\n    // Other interface methods\n}\n\n\nHow It Works: The WCF runtime integrates the behavior into the WCF pipeline\nbased on the context, such as during service or client operation.","index":93,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"95.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS IN WCF TO AVOID?","answer":"Let's look at some common anti-patterns that should be avoided when working with\nWCF.\n\n\nBAD PRACTICES\n\nNOT DEFINING CLIENTS AND SERVERS\n\nUsing WCF for direct client-to-client communication circumvents its\nservice-oriented approach, which may lead to less maintainable and scalable\nsystems.\n\nOVER-RELIANCE ON OBJECT SERIALIZATION\n\nWhile WCF can handle automatic object serialization, overusing this can lead to\nincreased network traffic and potential security concerns.\n\n\nNOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION SCENARIOS\n\nWCF provides multiple communication options, such as Duplex and One-Way. Not\nchoosing the most suitable one can impact the system's performance.\n\n\nMISUSE OF DATA CONTRACTS\n\n * Shared Data Types: Defining a shared data type in a data contract can lead to\n   coupling, making changes harder to implement. Consider using messages with\n   behavior instead.\n\n * Collections: Exposing the internal collection types can lead to unintended\n   changes by clients. Instead, use proxy classes or provide operations for\n   collection manipulation.\n\n * Inheritance and Polymorphism: While WCF supports inheritance in data\n   contracts, overuse can result in complexity and difficult maintenance. It's\n   recommended to use composition over inheritance.\n\n\nTHE SYSTEM IS TIGHTER THAN IT SHOULD BE\n\nTIGHTER THAN COUPLED\n\n * Accessing Service Hosts Directly: Interacting with the service host directly\n   leads to a tight coupling of the service implementation with the hosting\n   environment. This limits deployment options and flexibility.\n\n * Over the Boundaries: Operations that span across multiple boundary layers,\n   such as the UI and service layer, should be avoided.\n\n * Infrastructural Conundrum: Including infrastructure-related logic, like\n   exception handling and logging, within the business logic layer leads to an\n   overly intertwined system.\n\nCONSUMING MORE RESOURCES THAN NECESSARY\n\n * Using One Size for All: WCF provides different instance and concurrency\n   modes. Choosing inappropriate modes like Per-Called when Singleton could\n   suffice might lead to resource contention.\n\n * Service Classes on Training Wheels: Marking service classes as Thread-Safe\n   when it isn't necessary can potentially impact performance.\n\nUNDERESTIMATING THE POWER OF ABSTRACTIONS\n\n * Exposing Concrete Types: Directly returning or expecting concrete types in a\n   service contract might lead to a lack of flexibility and hinder\n   interoperability.\n\n * Tying Types to Operations: Data types should be agnostic of the operations\n   that use them. Creating operation-specific data types uses unnecessary\n   service level types.\n\nThe key here is to ensure a proper balance between granularity and reusability,\nso the service isn't overly specified, but also caters to distinct, logical\nareas of functionality.","index":94,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"96.\n\n\nHOW IS WCF BEING USED IN MODERN ENTERPRISES?","answer":"Many modern enterprises use WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) for creating\nservice-oriented applications.

Data Contract Transformation: Data contracts in REST are typically\n    JSON-based and more flexible than their SOAP counterparts. Prepare to\n    accommodate this change.\n\n 4. Transport Protocol Transition: Moving from WCF (which allows multiple\n    transport options) to REST usually means using HTTP as the sole transport.\n    This requires adaptations to security methods and request-response patterns.\n\n 5. Security Rethink: With REST, security often centers around HTTPS and tokens.\n    WCF offers more comprehensive options like message-level security. Ensure\n    your REST service aligns with your security needs.\n\n 6. Hosting Environment Adjustment: WCF can be self-hosted or use IIS. RESTful\n    services are often reliant on full-fledged containers like IIS or tools like\n    Kestrel. Plan for this change.\n\n 7. Client Reconfiguration: Clients previously using proxy classes in a WCF\n    context will need to be reconfigured when interacting with RESTful services.\n    The endpoints are different, and serialization methods may vary.\n\n 8. Monitoring and Logging: Prepare to adjust your monitoring and logging tools\n    to suit the new service setup.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION\n\n * Incremental Changes: Migrate capabilities one at a time. This piecemeal\n   approach can reduce the impact on the application.\n\n * Comprehensive Testing: Adopt a robust testing strategy that includes unit,\n   integration, and possibly, distributed testing.\n\n * Versioning and Compatibility: If required, maintain multiple versions of your\n   service during the transition to avoid breaking changes.\n\n * Real-time Monitoring: Use tools that provide a live view of your system.\n\n * Track Performance Metrics: Compare pre- and post-transition performance to\n   identify regressions.\n\n * Work with Libraries with a Uniform REST Interface: Consistency across\n   different services simplifies client code.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: WCF TO REST TRANSITION\n\nHere is the C# code:\n\n// WCF service contract\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IWcfService\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    string GetData(int value);\n}\n\n// REST service contract\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface IRestService\n{\n    [OperationContract(Method = \"GET\", UriTemplate = \"GetData?value={value}\")]\n    string GetData(string value);\n}\n","index":99,"topic":" WCF ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
