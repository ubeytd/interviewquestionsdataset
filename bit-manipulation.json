In contrast, our day-to-day decimal system is base-10, utilizing ten\nnumerals (0-9).\n\nIn the binary system:\n\n * Bit: Represents 0 or 1\n * Nibble: Comprises 4 bits, representing 16 values (0-15 in decimal)\n * Byte: Contains 8 bits, representing 256 values (0-255 in decimal)\n\nFor instance, the decimal number 5 is depicted as 010120101_201012 in binary.\n\n\nBIT MANIPULATION\n\nBits are pivotal in bit manipulation, a field encompassing operations like bit\nshifting, logical operations (AND, OR, XOR), and bit masking. These techniques\nfind applications in data compression, encryption, and device control.\n\nConsidering two 8-bit numbers: 0010 10100010\\,101000101010 and\n0000 11000000\\,110000001100.
