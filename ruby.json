Its main claim to fame in web development\nis the web application framework, Ruby on Rails (RoR), which transformed the way\nweb applications are built by promoting convention over configuration.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES & CONTRIBUTIONS TO WEB DEVELOPMENT\n\n * Language Syntax: Ruby's syntax has an appeasing natural language style. This,\n   paired with its dynamic typing, powerful metaprogramming features, and\n   absence of semicolons, results in clean and expressive code.\n\n * Gems: Ruby's package manager, RubyGems, simplifies library management, making\n   it easy to integrate numerous third-party extensions.\n\n * Database Integration: ActiveRecord, a popular object-relational mapping\n   system, aids in managing database records via a natural, object-oriented\n   interface.\n\n * MVC Pattern: Rails, in particular, is famed for its adherence to the\n   Model-View-Controller pattern, offering a clear separation of concerns.\n\n * Code Rearrangement: The auto-loading mechanism allows for seamless navigation\n   between related files and classes while coding.\n\n * Ecosystem Consistency: RoR brought about a many-to-many relationship with\n   databases, streamlining and simplifying existing development patterns.\n\n * Strong Community: The language's supportive community and its commitment to\n   clean, readable code are evident in guiding principles like \"Mediterranean\"\n   quality and \"Matz's kindness.\"\n\n * Test-Driven Development: RoR promotes best-testing practices from the\n   project's inception, ensuring reliability.\n\n * Giant Corporations' Indulgence: Prominent organizations such as GitHub,\n   Shopify, and Airbnb have successfully tapped into the potential of Ruby on\n   Rails.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: RUBY ON RAILS (ROR) ROUTING\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# config/routes.rb\nRails.application.routes.draw do\n  root 'welcome#index'\n  get 'products/:id', to: 'products#show'\n  resources :articles\nend\n\n\nThis file configures routes for different URLs, specifying which controllers and\nactions to invoke. For instance, upon receiving a GET request for products/5,\nRoR would route it to the show action in the ProductsController with the ID\nparameter set to 5. Such straightforward setups contribute to RoR's appeal.","index":0,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU CREATE A RUBY SCRIPT FILE AND EXECUTE IT ON A COMMAND LINE?","answer":"First, you create a Ruby script file with a .rb extension that contains your\nRuby code. You can then execute this script using the ruby command in your\ncommand line.\n\n\nBASIC STEPS FOR CREATING AND RUNNING A RUBY SCRIPT IN A FILE\n\n 1. Create a File: Use any text editor to write your Ruby code, and save the\n    file with a .rb extension, e.g., my_ruby_script.rb.\n\n 2. Write Ruby Code: Here is a simple example.\n    \n    # Filename: my_ruby_script.rb\n    puts \"Hello, Ruby Script!\"\n    \n\n 3. Run the Ruby Script: Go to your command line and navigate to the folder\n    where the Ruby file is saved. Then, type the following command:\n    \n    ruby my_ruby_script.rb\n    \n    \n    After pressing enter, you will see the output:\n    \n    Hello, Ruby Script!\n    \n\n\nGETTING MORE ADVANCED\n\nCOMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS\n\nYou can access command-line arguments using special variables called ARGV.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n# Filename: script_with_args.rb\nputs \"Arguments: #{ARGV.join(', ')}\"\n\n\nIn the command line, you would run this script as:\n\nruby script_with_args.rb arg1 arg2 arg3\n\n\nThe output would be:\n\nArguments: arg1, arg2, arg3\n\n\nINTERACTIVE SCRIPTS\n\nRuby scripts can engage with users using the gets method.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n# Filename: interactive_script.rb\nputs \"What is your name?\"\nname = gets.chomp\nputs \"Hello, #{name}!\"\n\n\nWhen you run this script using ruby interactive_script.rb, it will prompt you\nfor your name, and after you provide it, it will greet you.\n\nBACKGROUND PROCESSING\n\nIf you want a script to run in the background without blocking your command\nline, you can use the & character.\n\nFor instance, to run a script called background_script.rb in the background, you\ncan use:\n\nruby background_script.rb &\n\n\nRUBY SHELL\n\nFor more complex shell operations, Ruby offers the shell library.\n\nHere is the sample code:\n\nrequire 'shell'\n\n# Use 'open' to open a URL in your default browser.\nsh = Shell.new\nsh.open \"https://example.com\"\n","index":1,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE BASIC DATA TYPES IN RUBY?","answer":"Ruby is claimed to treat \"everything as an object\". But like many languages,\nRuby has both primitive and abstract data types.\n\n\nPRIMITIVE TYPES\n\n * Numbers:\n   * Integers can be of any size (limited by system memory).\n   * Floating-Point numbers follow the IEEE 754 standard.\n * Booleans: Represented by true and false.\n * Symbols: Unique, immutable identifiers represented with a : followed by a\n   name.\n\n\nABSTRACT TYPES\n\n * Strings: Unicode with multiple encodings.\n * Arrays: Ordered, indexed collections.\n * Hashes: Key-value pairs, also known as dictionaries or maps in other\n   languages.\n\n\nOTHERS ASSIMILATED PRIMITIVE TYPES\n\nRuby, despite its philosophy of being completely object-oriented, has some\nunderlying primitive paradigms due to its performance concerns and efficiency\nconsiderations.\n\n * nil: Represents 'nothing' or 'empty'. It's the only instance of NilClass.\n\n * Booleans: While true and false are themselves keywords, any other value in\n   Ruby is considered truthy in a conditional context.\n\n\nADVANCED TYPES\n\n * Rational Numbers: Represented as a fraction (e.g., 1/3r).\n * Complex Numbers: Have real and imaginary parts (e.g., 2 + 3i).\n * Dates and Times: Provide various built-in classes like Time for dealing with\n   date and time values.\n\n\nRUBY UNIQUENESS\n\nRuby shuns a \"strictly-typed\" system. Variables need not be declared upfront and\ncan be reassigned to different types during execution. This freedom, although\nliberating, can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in larger codebases.","index":2,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SYMBOLS AND STRINGS IN RUBY.","answer":"Ruby features both strings and symbols, each with distinct use cases.\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\n * Type: Strings are of class String, while symbols are instances of Symbol.\n * Mutability: Strings are mutable, symbols are not.\n * Memory: Symbols are stored as a single, unique object in memory, while each\n   string is unique.\n * Performance: As symbols are immutable, lookups are faster than for equivalent\n   strings.\n\n\nPRIMARY USAGES\n\n * Strings: For text and dynamic data that may change or be unique across\n   different objects or occurrences.\n * Symbols: Typically used as keys for hashes or unique identifiers in the\n   program. They're advantageous for lookup efficiency and when the actual\n   content of the identifier is less relevant than its unique identity.\n\n\nMEMORY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n * As symbols are stored only once in memory, they are memory-efficient in\n   certain scenarios, like using the same symbol across different objects or\n   operations. Be cautious, though, as unnecessarily creating a large number of\n   symbols can lead to memory bloat.\n * Strings may be more memory-intensive, especially when there are numerous\n   unique strings. However, they are the right choice when dealing with data\n   that genuinely varies or where mutability is required.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STRING VS SYMBOL\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Strings\nstr_1 = \"Hello\"\nstr_2 = \"Hello\"\nputs str_1.object_id == str_2.object_id  # Output: false\n\n# Symbols\nsym_1 = :hello\nsym_2 = :hello\nputs sym_1.object_id == sym_2.object_id  # Output: true\n","index":3,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nHOW ARE CONSTANTS DECLARED AND WHAT IS THEIR SCOPE IN RUBY?","answer":"In Ruby, you declare a constant by using all uppercase letters. Constants are\nsubject to lexical scoping. While reassignment is technically possible (spawning\na warning), it should be avoided as a practice.\n\n\nCONSTANT DECLARATION\n\nYou can declare a Ruby constant using Object::CONSTANT notation or by assigning\na value directly to an identifier.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONSTANT DECLARATION\n\n# Using Object::CONSTANT notation\nMath::PI \n\n# Direct assignment\nRADIUS = 5.0\n\n\n\nCONSTANT SCOPE\n\nConstants have a global scope, but their visibility can be restricted within\nclasses and modules.\n\nGLOBAL VS. LOCAL SCOPE\n\n * Global Scope: Constants are accessible throughout the entire application.\n   \n   A = 1     # Top level\n   module M\n     puts A  # Outputs: 1\n   end\n   \n\n * Local Scope: Constants are defined within a module or a class.\n   \n   module M\n     A = 2\n     A = 3\n     puts A  # Outputs: 3\n   end\n   \n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Avoid re-assigning constants. Although this generates a warning, the\n   reassignment can still take place, which can lead to unintended behavior.\n * For areas where you want to have a constant's value remain unchanged, use\n   .freeze on the constant or variable storing the constant's value.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: AVOIDING REASSIGNMENT\n\nrequire \"warning\"\n\n# Generates a warning: already initialized constant\nA = 1\nA = 2 \n\nwarning 'constant reassignment'\n\nputs A  # Outputs: 2\n\n\nOBJECT#FREEZE\n\nCIRCLE_AREA = Math::PI * (RADIUS ** 2)\nCIRCLE_AREA.freeze\n\n# Any reassignment will generate an error\n# CIRCLE_AREA = 100 \n\nputs CIRCLE_AREA\n","index":4,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE USE OF 'REQUIRE' AND 'INCLUDE' IN RUBY.","answer":"Ruby uses both Require and Include to manage dependencies and to mix modules\ninto classes.\n\n\nREQUIRE\n\n * Purpose: Loads external libraries, enabling access to their defined classes\n   and modules.\n\n * Execution: Done at the top of the file or script.\n\n * Trigger: A LoadError is raised if the required file is not found.\n\n * State Management: Tracks loaded libraries, subsequently ignoring further\n   require calls for the same library.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: USING REQUIRE\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# In file application.rb\nrequire 'my_library'\n\n# In file my_library.rb\nclass MyLibrary\n  # ...\nend\n\n\n\nINCLUDE\n\n * Purpose: Integrates a module's methods within a class, giving the class\n   access to those methods.\n\n * Execution: On the specific class that necessitates the module's\n   functionality.\n\n * State: Not applicable for classes, as they can include multiple modules.\n\nWHY IS IT USED?\n\n * Require: Ensures the presence of the external library before continuing, a\n   basic necessity for external code.\n * Include: Mixes in module functionality only when needed, aligning with Rails'\n   convention of using it in the classes contextually.","index":5,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nWHAT ARE RUBY ITERATORS AND HOW DO THEY WORK?","answer":"When it comes to Ruby, iterators allow for easy, streamlined data manipulation.\nWhether you're working with arrays, ranges, or other data structures, iterators\nhelp you efficiently apply operations to each element without needing to manage\nloop counters.\n\n\nMOST COMMON RUBY ITERATORS\n\n * Each: The most basic iterator, it goes through each element.\n * Each with index: Similar to each, but it also gives the index of the current\n   element.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: EACH & EACH WITH INDEX\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\narr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\n# Iterating with Each\narr.each { |num| puts num }\n\n# Output:\n# 5\n# 4\n# 3\n# 2\n# 1\n\n# Iterating with Each with Index\narr.each_with_index { |num, index| puts \"#{index}: #{num}\" }\n\n# Output:\n# 0: 5\n# 1: 4\n# 2: 3\n# 3: 2\n# 4: 1\n\n\n\nCOMMON USAGE\n\n * Each Char: Often used with strings, this iterator loops through each\n   character.\n * Each Line: Handy for reading files, it processes lines one at a time.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: EACH CHAR & EACH LINE\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nstr = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Iterating Each Character\nstr.each_char { |char| puts char }\n\n# Output:\n# H\n# e\n# l\n# l\n# o\n# ,\n# ...\n\n\nFile.open('example.txt').each_line do |line|\n  puts line\nend\n\n\n\nPREDICATIVE ITERATORS\n\nThese iterators select elements from a collection that match specific\nconditions. They are typically used in combination with blocks.\n\nExamples include select, reject, and grep. Each is designed to achieve specific\nselection goals:\n\n * select returns elements that yield true in the block.\n * reject returns elements that yield false in the block.\n * grep returns elements that match a specified pattern.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SELECT, REJECT, AND GREP\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Select even numbers\nnumbers.select { |num| num.even? }\n\n# Reject short names\nnames.reject { |name| name.length < 5 }\n\n# Grep to find email addresses\ntext = \"Email me at user@example.com\"\ntext.grep(/\\b\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+\\b/)\n\n\n\nCHASE & TRANSFORM\n\nThese iterators process the elements and return a result. They include map,\ncollect, and partition.\n\n * map: Transforms each input and returns a new array.\n * collect: Identical to map, but ops include the return value.\n * partition: Separates elements into two groups based on whether the block\n   returns true or false.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MAP, COLLECT, AND PARTITION\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Double each number\nnumbers.map { |num| num * 2 }\n\n# Names all uppercase\nnames.collect { |name| name.upcase }\n\n# Split numbers based on even or odd\nnumbers.partition { |num| num.even? }\n\n\n\nEXECUTE OPERATIONS\n\nThese iterators modify their elements or perform side effects. Examples include\neach and each_with_index.\n\nOften used for their simplicity, do exercise caution as these functions can have\nunexpected results, especially when combined with unintended side effects.\n\n * each: Processes each element but does not return anything.\n * each_with_index: Similar to each, but also gives the index of the current\n   element.\n\n\nSORT-RELATED OPERATIONS\n\nWhen working with ordered collections like arrays or ranges, Ruby provides\nvarious sorting options. Common sorting iterators include sort, sort_by, and\nreverse_each. They all work with blocks to customize the sorting or iteration\nbehavior.\n\n\nREPETITION-BASED ITERATORS\n\nThese Ruby constructs are particularly useful in the context of text\nmanipulation, allowing you to repeat characters (such as hyphens for formatting\nheaders) for a specified number of times.\n\n * each_line: Useful when processing multi-line strings or files.\n * each_char: Ideal for character-level processing in strings or enumerations.\n * downto: Iterates downwards to a specified value.\n * upto: Iterates upwards to a specified value.\n * times: Repeats the associated block a predetermined number of times.\n * step: Indents a set number of times, confined by a range.\n * cycle: Used primarily with blocks, it repeatedly moves through the specified\n   range.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REPETITION-BASED ITERATORS\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Print a line of stars\n'*'.upto('*****') { |s| puts s }\n\n# Output:\n# *\n# **\n# ***\n# ****\n# *****\n\n# Print numbers from 5 to 10, then their squares\n5.upto(10) { |num| puts num }\n5.upto(10).each { |num| puts num**2 }\n","index":6,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nHOW ARE ERRORS HANDLED IN RUBY?","answer":"Ruby's exception hierarchy enables developers to manage different kinds of\nerrors. The two main exception types cater to a multitude of issues:\n\n * StandardError: For generic problems that occur during code execution.\n * SystemCallError: Specifically deals with errors originating from system\n   calls.\n\n\nWAYS TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS IN RUBY\n\nTOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION HANDLING\n\nRuby leverages the at_exit method for centralized error handling. This approach\nis mainly useful for logging errors before program exit or for cleaning up\nresources.\n\nat_exit do\n  puts $!.message if $!\nend\n\n\nSINGLE STATEMENT UNWIND\n\nUtilize inline rescue, marked by the begin and end block. If an exception arises\nduring the evaluation of the enclosed expression, it's caught.\n\nresult = begin\n  raise StandardError, \"This is an error\"\nrescue StandardError => e\n  \"Rescued: #{e.message}\"\nend\n\nputs result  # Output: Rescued: This is an error\n\n\n\nCUSTOM EXCEPTION HANDLING\n\nDevelopers benefit from creating their custom exception classes or identifying\nspecific exception types to tailor their error management strategies.\n\nDEFINING CUSTOM EXCEPTION CLASSES\n\nThe Exception class or, more preferably, its subclass, StandardError, are\nparents to all user-defined exceptions. This inheritance ensures that all custom\nexceptions are catchable via rescue.\n\nclass MyCustomError < StandardError\n  # Additional behavior or settings\nend\n\nraise MyCustomError, \"Something went wrong!\"\n\n\nIDENTIFYING THE RIGHT EXCEPTION\n\nAn error's distinct nature often demands a corresponding exception. For\ninstance, consider a method handling file operations:\n\ndef read_file(file_path)\n  raise ArgumentError, \"File path is empty\" if file_path.to_s.empty?\n  raise IOError, \"File not found\" unless File.exist?(file_path)\n\n  File.read(file_path)\nend\n\n\nUpon calling read_file, any exception correlated to an invalid file path can be\nreliably caught and addressed with a targeted rescue block.\n\n\nERROR HANDLING BEST PRACTICES\n\n * Keep it Precise: Make use of granular rescue blocks or case statements to\n   align the corrective measures with the specific error.\n\n * Maintain a Balance: Overuse of exceptions can convolute code and hinder its\n   readability. Carefully select the exceptions likely to surface and\n   necessitate special attention.\n\n * Locale Transparency: Choose either a local exception resolver that terminates\n   in the current method or a global one that percolates up the call stack, but\n   aim for consistency.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhile exceptions can be invaluable for isolated and unexpected mishaps,\ntriggering and managing them incurs a performance cost.

Database Schemas: Named fields and tables allow the ORM to deduce\n    relationships and configurations.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: CRUD ACTIONS IN ROR\n\nIn Ruby on Rails, the \"conventions\" for a resourceful route automatically map\nHTTP verbs to CRUD actions:\n\n# config/routes.rb\nresources :articles\n\n# Routes:\n# HTTP   Path                Controller#Action    Used For\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# GET    /articles           articles#index       Display a list\n# GET    /articles/:id       articles#show        Display a specific article\n# GET    /articles/new       articles#new         Display a form to create a new article\n# POST   /articles           articles#create      Add a new article to the database\n# GET    /articles/:id/edit  articles#edit        Display a form to edit an existing article\n# PATCH  /articles/:id       articles#update      Update an existing article in the database\n# PUT    /articles/:id       articles#update      (Alternate for update)\n# DELETE /articles/:id       articles#destroy     Remove a specific article from the database\n\n\nHere, the convention to map action names to routes frees the developer from\nconfiguring each route manually.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n * Speed: It streamlines development and reduces boilerplate.\n * Interoperability: CoC enables consistency across different projects and\n   teams.\n\n\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\n * Over-optimization: While it's efficient for simple, well-understood\n   requirements, it can make advanced configurations and customizations\n   cumbersome.\n * Learning Curve: Newcomers might find it challenging to adapt to these\n   standard conventions.\n * Magic: Over-reliance on CoC can make the system seem like it has hidden,\n   unexplained behaviors.","index":13,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nHOW DOES RUBY SUPPORT METAPROGRAMMING?","answer":"Ruby offers powerful metaprogramming capabilities, enabling developers to write\nflexible, dynamic code. Key to Ruby's metaprogramming are class methods such as\ndefine_method and language features like Open Classes leading to advanced\ntechniques like Dynamic Dispatch.\n\n\nDYNAMIC DISPATCH MECHANISM\n\n * Dynamic Dispatch: Methods can be called at runtime, based on the object's\n   context, using send. This makes it easier to manage method invocations in\n   metaprogrammed code.\n\nclass MathOperations\n  def do_operation(operator, x, y)\n    send(operator, x, y) # Dynamic dispatch\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def add(x, y)\n    x + y\n  end\n\n  def subtract(x, y)\n    x - y\n  end\nend\n\nresult = MathOperations.new.do_operation(:add, 10, 5) # 15\n\n\n\nCLASS MODIFICATIONS WITH OPEN CLASSES\n\n * Open Classes: Ruby allows changing a class's definition dynamically, even\n   after its initial declaration.\n   \n   This example adds a reverse method to the String class.\n   \n   class String\n     def reverse\n       chars.reverse.join\n     end\n   end\n   \n\n\nCODE EVALUATION AND EXECUTION\n\n * Code Evaluation: Code strings can be executed within a bound context,\n   enabling runtime code execution and evaluation.\n   \n   This is an example using eval to define a method at runtime, equivalent to\n   def double(x) x * 2; end, but the method signature is constructed\n   dynamically.\n   \n   method_signature = 'double(x)'\n   method_body = 'x * 2'\n   eval(\"def #{method_signature}; #{method_body}; end\")\n   \n\n * Binding Tasks: proc objects capture both the method (or block) and its\n   associated context. They can be transferred across lexical scopes, allowing\n   delayed execution of code.\n   \n   context = binding\n   task = Proc.new { eval 'some_method', context }\n   \n\n * Context Toggling: By toggling a method's visibility, you can control its\n   access scope.\n   \n   class MyClass\n     def some_method\n       \"Public method\"\n     end\n   \n   private\n   \n     def toggle_method_visibility(visibility)\n       # `send` here is being used for dynamic dispatch\n       send(visibility, :some_method)\n     end\n   end\n   \n   instance = MyClass.new\n   instance.toggle_method_visibility(:private)\n   \n\n\nINTERNATIONALIZATION: ADVANCED USE OF SEND AND EVAL\n\n * Localizing Method Calls: In internationalization tasks where method calls\n   need to be localized, send, public_send, or even the more general eval can be\n   suitable.\n   \n   def greeting(language)\n     eval(\"#{language}_greeting\")\n   end\n   \n   def spanish_greeting\n     \"Hola Mundo\"\n   end\n   \n\n\nMETHOD MISSING AND MISSING METHOD FEATURE\n\n * Method Missing: This feature is the heart of Ruby's duck typing. It allows\n   classes and objects to respond to method calls even when their definitions\n   are absent, rather than resorting to method-not-found errors.\n   \n   This example cleans up a method call, removing spaces or underscores.\n   \n   def method_missing(name, *args, &block)\n     cleaned_name = name.to_s.delete(' ').delete('_')\n     send(cleaned_name, *args, &block)\n   end\n   \n\n * respond_to_missing?: This method is often used in conjunction with\n   method_missing, providing a way for a class to communicate whether it handles\n   a method call beyond what is statically defined.","index":14,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"16.\n\n\nDEFINE CLASSES AND MODULES IN RUBY.","answer":"Before I start answering the questions, let's get an understanding of what\nModeling Classes and Modules in Ruby are.\n\n\nBEYOND PLAIN OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING\n\nRuby introduces Mixins and Namespacing to enhance class behavior and structure,\ntaking you beyond what's typically seen in simple OOP models.\n\n\nKEY ELEMENTS\n\n * Classes: Serve as blueprints for creating objects.

This approach is known as\nprinciple of least surprise.\n\nclass A\n  def name\n    \"A's name\"\n  end\nend\n\nclass B < A\nend\n\nclass C < B\n  def name\n    \"C's name\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Method lookup for C instance:\n# Results in \"C's name\" as that's the most recent definition.\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the method lookup mechanism is to locate and execute\nmethods when they are called on the instances of various classes.\n\n\nMIXINS\n\nFor the inheritance of behaviors from multiple modules, Ruby uses a construct\ncalled a mixin. A mixin is represented by a module and is included in classes to\nextend their behavior.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that related methods or behaviors can be\ngrouped together in a module and then shared with multiple classes. The include\ndirective is used to mix in such modules.\n\nmodule Greet\n  def say_hello\n    \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  include Greet\nend\n\n\nBecause modules can include other modules, they can create complex behaviors,\nreusability, and composition structures.\n\n\nTHE POWER OF OBJECT COMPOSITION\n\nIn Ruby, composition via object containment is often preferred over inheritance.\n\nThis philosophy is encapsulated in the phrase, \"Prefer object composition to\nclass inheritance\", and is known as the Composition Over Inheritance principle.\n\nObject containment focuses on building functionalities using other classes and\nmodules, leading to more modular and maintainable code.","index":16,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"18.\n\n\nWHAT IS METHOD OVERRIDING IN RUBY?","answer":"Method overriding in Ruby refers to the practice of redefining a method in a\nderived class, which then takes precedence over the method with the same name in\nthe base class.

They are different\nfrom class methods, which are shared among all instances.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nEvery object in Ruby is an instance of a class. Sometimes an object might need a\nmethod that's specific to just that object.\n\nRuby allows you to define singleton methods for objects. In a way, this\ntemporarily alters an object's class to include this unique method.\n\nWhen you call a method on an object, Ruby first checks the class of that object\nto see if it defines the method. If not, it checks to see if any singleton\nmethods have been defined for that specific object.\n\nIf a singleton method is found, it's executed; else Ruby moves up the\ninheritance or module hierarchy.\n\nHere is a \"metaprogramming\" technique for adding a singleton method to an object\nor a class using the concept of \"eigenclass\".\n\nWhen a class object is created, its superclass is Class, thus the\nsingleton_class would be the base object, whether it's a class or an instance of\na class.\n\n\nPRACTICAL USE-CASE: SINGLETON PATTERN\n\nThe Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides\na global access point to that instance. The singleton can be implemented using\neither a class method or a singleton_method.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SINGLETON METHOD VIA A CLASS METHOD\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nclass SingletonExample\n  def self.instance\n    @instance ||= new\n  end\nend\n\n# Usage\nsingleton = SingletonExample.instance\n\n\nObserve here, the .instance method is a regular class method that retrieves or\ninitializes the single shared instance.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SINGLETON METHOD VIA A SINGLETON_METHOD\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\ngadget = Object.new\n\n# Define a singleton method just for this \"gadget\" object\ndef gadget.use\n  puts 'Gadget is activated.'\nend\n\n# Using the singleton method\ngadget.use  # Output: \"Gadget is activated.\"\n\n\nFor gadget object only, the use method is defined and unavailable to other\nobjects.

This property of method dispatch,\nwhere the method called is determined during runtime based on the actual object\nand not just its reference type, is distinct to Ruby and a feature of any\nobject-oriented language that follows the message passing paradigm.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nWhen you make a method call in Ruby, the language looks for a matching method\nstarting from the most defined class and moving towards parent classes or\nmodules. As soon as a method is found, the search stops, and that method is\nexecuted.\n\nThis process, known as method lookup, typically involves a chain that might\ninclude:\n\n * The class that the object is an instance of\n * Any modules that the class includes\n * The class's ancestors up to Object and BasicObject\n\nThis dynamic method dispatch ensures that a method call always leads to the most\nspecific method for the actual object type. If no matching method is found in\nthe lookup chain, Ruby raises a NoMethodError.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: METHOD LOOKUP\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nmodule ModuleA\n  def hello\n    \"Hello from ModuleA\"\n  end\nend\n\nclass Parent\n  include ModuleA\n\n  def hello\n    \"Hello from Parent\"\n  end\nend\n\nclass Child < Parent\n  def hello\n    \"Hello from Child\"\n  end\nend\n\nobj = Child.new\nputs obj.hello\n\n# Outputs:\n# Hello from Child\n\n\nIn this example, upon invoking hello on obj, the method defined in Child is the\nmost specific one in the chain, and so it's the method that gets executed.\n\n\nADVANTAGES AND BEST PRACTICES\n\n 1. Flexibility: Virtual methods enable polymorphism, allowing objects of\n    different classes in a hierarchy to respond to the same method call in a way\n    that's most appropriate to their nature.\n\n 2. Code Reusability: By defining common interfaces that methods adhere to, it's\n    possible to write code that doesn't make assumptions about the exact nature\n    of its targets. This, in turn, enables more general and reusable code.\n\n 3. Simplicity: The nature of virtual methods in Ruby aligns with the language's\n    philosophy of \"convention over configuration.\" It removes the need for\n    explicit method declarations as virtual, emphasizing the common case and\n    reducing unnecessary verbosity.\n\n 4. Dynamic Method Definitions: It provides a way for classes to define behavior\n    dynamically based on runtime conditions, making Ruby code natural and\n    expressive.\n\n\nVIRTUAL VS NON-VIRTUAL IN OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nWhile languages like Java or C# make a distinction between virtual and\nnon-virtual methods and require the use of specific keywords like virtual or\noverride, Ruby handles method dispatch based on the object's actual class or\nmodule inclusion. The absence of dedicated keywords for this purpose makes Ruby\nmethods effectively \"always virtual.\"","index":22,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"24.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU PREVENT AN OBJECT FROM BEING INSTANTIATED IN RUBY?","answer":"In Ruby, you can't control object instantiation at a language level.

Consistent API: All Enumerable methods adhere to a common API, simplifying\n    their usage.\n\n 2. Element Selection: It allows straightforward operations for choosing\n    behavior based on element properties and conditions.\n\n 3. Chaining: Many Enumerable methods can be linked or \"chained\" together,\n    resulting in powerful and concise data processing pipelines.\n\n 4. Reductions: Certain methods can summarize a collection to a single value,\n    such as finding the maximum.\n\n 5. Thread Consistency: Thread-safe operations ensure data integrity across\n    concurrent scenarios.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: FILTERING AND TRANSFORMING DATA\n\nLet's say you have a list of products and need to present their descriptions,\nbut only for those that are on sale:\n\nproducts = [\n  {name: 'A', price: 30, status: :sale},\n  {name: 'B', price: 50, status: :regular}\n  # ...\n]\n\nsale_products_descriptions = products\n  .select { |product| product[:status] == :sale }\n  .map { |sale_product| \"Name: #{sale_product[:name]}, Price: #{sale_product[:price]}\" }\n\nputs sale_products_descriptions\n\n\nThe code employs Enumerable methods to streamline the task, ensuring it's both\nreadable and efficient.\n\n\nCODE RECAP\n\n 1. Initializer: List of product hash-map.\n 2. Select: Chooses items where :status matches :sale.\n 3. Map: Transforms from products to strings that describe the sale items.\n 4.

Version Control: A git repository to manage gem history.\n\nSeveral gem-specific gems streamline the process even further:\n\n * Bundler: Facilitates gem development and establishes dependencies.\n * Rake: Useful for automating gem development tasks.\n\n\nCOMMON GEM TOPOLOGIES\n\nRuby gems generally cluster around specific categories or functionalities. Some\ncommon topologies include:\n\n * Single Module Gem: Simple gems designed around a single functionality. All\n   classes and modules reside under the gem's namespace.\n * Multiple Module Gem: More complex gems that house multiple modules and\n   potentially sub-gems or plugins.\n * Stub Gem: Acts as a thin layer over an existing library, considerably useful\n   when working with third-party libraries.\n\n\nKEY GEM COMPONENTS\n\nLet's review the essential elements of a Ruby Gem in the context of a\nhypothetical gem \"my-awesome-gem\".\n\nGEM STRUCTURE\n\nHere is the directory structure for a basic gem:\n\nmy-awesome-gem\n├── bin\n|   └── my-awesome-script\n├── lib\n|   ├── my-awesome-gem.rb\n|   └── my\n|       └── awesome\n|           └── gem\n|               └── version.rb\n├── spec\n|   ├── spec_helper.rb\n|   └── my-awesome-gem_spec.rb\n├── .gitignore\n├── Gemfile\n├── my-awesome-gem.gemspec\n└── Rakefile\n\n\n * bin: Contains executable scripts; not all gems have this directory.\n * lib: Where the core code lies.\n * spec: Houses test (RSpec) files.\n * .gitignore: Lists files or directories to be ignored in version control.\n * Gemfile: Specifies gem dependencies for development.\n * .gemspec: Holds gem metadata.\n * Rakefile: hosts gem-related tasks.\n\nGEMSPEC FILE\n\nHere is a sample .gemspec file:\n\n# Replace placeholders with your gem details\n# my-awesome-gem.gemspec\nlib = File.expand_path('lib', __FILE__)\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift(lib) unless $LOAD_PATH.include?(lib)\nrequire 'my-awesome-gem/version'\n\nGem::Specification.new do |spec|\n  spec.name          = 'my-awesome-gem'\n  spec.version       = MyAwesomeGem::VERSION\n  spec.authors       = ['Your Name']\n  spec.email         = ['youremail@example.com']\n  spec.summary       = 'One-sentence summary of your gem'\n  spec.description   = 'A description of your gem'\n  spec.homepage      = 'https://github.com/your_username/my-awesome-gem'\n  spec.license       = 'MIT'\n\n  spec.files         = `git ls-files -z`.split(\"\\x0\")\n  spec.executables   = spec.files.grep(%r{\\Abin/}) { |f| File.basename(f) }\n  spec.test_files    = spec.files.grep(%r{\\Atest/})\n  spec.require_paths = ['lib']\n\n  spec.add_development_dependency 'bundler', '~> 2.0'\n  # Add any additional development dependencies here\nend\n\n\nCODEBASE\n\nThe primary gem file, my-awesome-gem.rb, might look like:\n\n# Inside my-awesome-gem.rb\nrequire 'my-awesome-gem/version'\nrequire 'my-awesome-gem/some_module'\nmodule MyAwesomeGem\n  # Your gem code here\nend\n\n\nThe version file, version.rb, typically looks like:\n\n# Inside version.rb\nmodule MyAwesomeGem\n  VERSION = '0.1.0'.freeze\nend\n\n\nVERSION CONTROL\n\nInitialize your project with Git and create your first commit:\n\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\n\n\nHANDLING DEPENDENCIES\n\nRUNTIME DEPENDENCIES\n\nUse the add_runtime_dependency method within the .gemspec file to specify the\ngem's runtime dependencies.\n\nDEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES\n\nSimilarly, use add_development_dependency within the .gemspec file to list\ndevelopment or testing related dependencies.\n\nHere is the updated .gemspec file:\n\n# .gemspec\nGem::Specification.new do |spec|\n  # ...

Gem Installation: Bundler installs project gems, creating or updating the\n    Gemfile.lock.\n 2. Gemfile.lock Verification: The presence of this file prompts Bundler to load\n    specific gem versions from it instead of the Gemfile.

View Rendering: The updated state, along with any relevant information from\n    the controller, is passed to the view, which then renders it.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TODO LIST WEB APPLICATION\n\nMODEL\n\nclass Task < ApplicationRecord # Activerecord\n  validates :title, presence: true\nend\n\n\nVIEW\n\n<!-- tasks/index.html.erb -->\n<% @tasks.each do |task| %>\n  <li><%= task.title %></li>\n<% end %>\n\n\nCONTROLLER\n\nclass TasksController < ApplicationController\n  def index\n    @tasks = Task.all\n  end\nend\n\n\nROUTING\n\n# config/routes.rb\nresources :tasks\n\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n * Simplicity: Developers can focus on distinct aspects of the application\n   without being overwhelmed by a monolithic structure.\n * Parallel Development: Teams can work efficiently as different elements are\n   developed in parallel.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL CHALLENGES\n\n * Learning Curve: Adopting the MVC pattern, especially for beginners, might\n   initially appear complicated.\n * Tighter Coupling: While MVC aims for loose coupling, achieving a perfect\n   balance can be tricky, especially in larger applications.\n\n\nRAILS VS MVC\n\n * Scaffolding: Rails' CLI tool can generate initial MVC components, providing a\n   head start.\n * Convention over Configuration: Instead of manual configurations, Rails makes\n   assumptions about how components are structured, streamlining development.","index":47,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"49.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW TO CREATE A NEW RAILS APPLICATION.","answer":"Creating a new Ruby on Rails application is straightforward and typically\ninvolves using the rails new command with specific options and flags.\n\n\nSTEPS TO CREATE A NEW RAILS APPLICATION\n\n 1. Install Dependencies (If Not Already Installed)\n    \n    * Ensure you have Ruby installed, with a version compatible with the Rails\n      version you intend to use.\n    * Use a package manager like RubyGems to install Rails: gem install rails\n\n 2. Create a New Rails Application\n    \n    * Run the following command in your project's parent directory:\n      \n      rails new myapp    # Replace 'myapp' with your application's name\n      \n\nThis command initializes a new directory called myapp and sets up a standard\nrails directory structure. Rails will also install and configure relevant gems\nand libraries, such as sqlite3 for the database by default and a JavaScript\nRuntime Environment (Node.js is a common choice).\n\n 3. Customize Database Settings (Optional)\n    \n    * If you have specific database needs, you can rails new with custom\n      settings, for example:\n      \n      rails new myapp --database=postgresql --skip-test\n      \n\n 4. Choose No-Asset Pipeline Over Sprockets (Optional)\n    \n    * If your application won't require Sprockets, specify --skip-sprockets.\n\n 5. Determine Additional Flags for a Leaner Setup (If Needed)\n    \n    * Consider --skip-bundle to avoid the initial bundle operation or --minimal\n      to opt for as slimmer a setup as possible.\n\n 6. Verify Your Terminal Output\n    \n    * Ensure all essential components, such as the web server (Puma by default),\n      are listed as \"installed.\"\n\n\nEXAMPLE: CREATING A NEW RAILS APPLICATION\n\nHere is the basic code:\n\nrails new myapp\n\n\nAlternatively, if you want to use PostgreSQL as your database:\n\nrails new myapp --database=postgresql --skip-test\n\n\nAlways consult the official Rails documentation for the most recent and accurate\ninformation regarding setup options and defaults.","index":48,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"50.\n\n\nWHAT IS ACTIVERECORD AND HOW DOES IT WORK?","answer":"ActiveRecord, a model in the MVC architecture, facilitates the interaction\nbetween an application and its database.

Sprockets: The asset pipeline's stand-out component, it's a Ruby library\n    that simplifies asset management tasks.\n 2. Ruby Gems: Often, additional gems like sass-rails and uglifier complement\n    the asset processing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n 1. Concatenation: Merges multiple files into a single one.\n 2. Minification: Reduces files' size by eliminating superfluous characters like\n    line breaks and white spaces.\n 3. Cyber Security Enhancements(Content Security Policy CSP): Helps in\n    minimizing threats from malicious endpoints or domains.\n 4. Caching: Leverages server-side URL fingerprinting to ensure assets only\n    update when modified.\n 5. Transpilation: Converts unsupported languages or formats into standard ones.\n    For example, CoffeeScript is transpiled to JavaScript.\n 6. Compression: Uses algorithms to condense asset sizes, such as gzip.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n 1. Request Handling: When the server gets an asset request, the asset pipeline\n    locates, processes, and delivers the asset.\n 2. Environments: The asset pipeline behaves differently based on the\n    operational context, distinguishing between development and production\n    environments.\n 3. Asset Fingerprinting: Each asset is associated with a unique digest so that\n    it only refreshes when modified, crucial for caching.\n\n\nASSET TYPES\n\n * Stylesheets: Written in Sass or SCSS, processed to generate CSS.\n * JavaScript: Can be in CoffeeScript or ES6. The asset pipeline transpiles it\n   to standard JavaScript.\n * Images and Fonts: These resources are copied to a public directory without\n   processing, retaining their original attributes.","index":50,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"52.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE ROUTES IN RAILS?","answer":"In Ruby on Rails, routing plays a pivotal role in directing incoming HTTP\nrequests to the appropriate controller actions.\n\n\nMECHANISM\n\nThe routing works based on the REST paradigm, which defines a set of actions\napplicable to resources.\n\nRESTFUL ACTIONS\n\n * Index (GET): Lists all resources.\n * Show (GET): Displays a specific resource.\n * New (GET): Renders a form to create a new resource.\n * Edit (GET): Renders a form to update an existing resource.\n * Create (POST): Persists a new resource to the database.\n * Update (PATCH/PUT): Updates an existing resource.\n * Destroy (DELETE): Deletes a resource.\n\n\nROUTES CONFIGURATION\n\nRoutes are typically configured in the routes.rb file. However, customization is\npossible.\n\nDEFAULT CONFIGURATION\n\nThe default resources and resource methods generate RESTful routes for\ncontrollers.\n\n# routes.rb\nresources :articles\n\n\nThe above line translates to seven RESTful actions:\n\n 1. Index: GET /articles\n 2. New: GET /articles/new\n 3. Create: POST /articles\n 4. Show: GET /articles/:id\n 5. Edit: GET /articles/:id/edit\n 6. Update: PATCH/PUT /articles/:id\n 7. Destroy: DELETE /articles/:id\n\nCUSTOM ROUTES\n\nCustom routes can be defined to address unique requirements, such as an action\nnot covered by default RESTful routes.\n\nFor example, to define a new route that manipulates multiples resources:\n\n# routes.rb\npost 'admin/retire' => 'admin#retire'\n\n\nIn this case, a POST request to /admin/retire will be directed to the retire\naction in the AdminController. Request parameters will be available in the\nparams hash.\n\n\nROUTE HELPERS\n\nRails simplifies URL handling through route helpers, generating URL and path\nmethods that map to defined routes.\n\nEXAMPLE: ROUTE HELPER FOR 'SHOW'\n\nFor an articles resource, the route helper article_path(@article) generates the\nappropriate URL for the Show action, taking the article's ID as an argument.\n\nThis helper translates to /articles/:id, with the :id placeholder being replaced\nby the actual article's ID.\n\nIn your Rails view or controller, you can readily use:\n\n<%= link_to 'Show Article', article_path(@article) %>\n\n\nThis code generates an HTML link that directs users to the specific article's\nShow page.","index":51,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"53.\n\n\nWHAT ARE RAILS MIGRATIONS?","answer":"Migrations in Ruby on Rails provide an organized way to manage a database\nschema, versioning, and incremental changes. Instead of using SQL directly to\nmanage the database, you describe changes in Ruby code which can be \"migrated\"\nup or down. This ensures that all developers and instances of the application\nhave the same schema version and that they can consistently update as the need\narises.\n\n\nSTEPS INVOLVED IN MIGRATIONS\n\n 1. Generate Migration: Using a built-in Rails command, you initiate the\n    creation of a migration file. This file, named in a timestamped format, will\n    reside in the db/migrate directory.\n    \n    rails generate migration AddTitleToProducts title:text\n    \n\n 2. Edit Migration: Open the generated migration file, where you'll write Ruby\n    code to describe the changes to your database schema. For instance, in the\n    up method, you might add a new column to a table.\n    \n    class AddTitleToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]\n      def change\n        add_column :products, :title, :string\n      end\n    end\n    \n\n 3. Run the Migration: With another Rails command, your database is updated to\n    align with the changes outlined in your migrations.\n    \n    rails db:migrate\n    \n\n\nPRACTICE GOOD VERSION CONTROL\n\nMigrations are crucial for maintaining a traceable history of your database\nschema. To ensure database schema version and integrity, it's recommended to:\n\n * Migrate Regularly: Particularly in team settings, keeping everyone's local or\n   live databases in sync is essential for consistency in development, testing,\n   and production environments.\n\n * Use Version Control: Like all code related to your application, migrations\n   should be tracked in a version control system, such as Git. This makes it\n   easier to understand who made what changes, when, and why.\n   \n   When operating in teams, good practices include regular communication about\n   the migration status, team members being proactive in running and creating\n   migrations, and being mindful of potential conflicts.\n   \n   Always remember to create backups before migrating in a production\n   environment.","index":52,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"54.\n\n\nHOW WOULD YOU IMPLEMENT AUTHENTICATION IN A RAILS APP?","answer":"In a typical Rails application, you achieve authentication using the Devise gem.\nDevise is a highly robust and customizable authentication solution that\ndramatically simplifies common authentication tasks such as user registration,\npassword management, and login/out.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES OF DEVISE\n\n * Modularity: Comprised of separate modules like recoverable, confirmable, and\n   lockable, Devise allows you to pick and choose functionality tailored to your\n   app's needs.\n * Security Best Practices: By default, Devise implements best security\n   practices like password hashing, token generation, parameter sanitization,\n   and more.\n * Customizable: While offering out-of-the-box solutions, Devise is also\n   eminently customizable, allowing you to modify or extend its behavior.\n\nDevise is lauded for its efficiency and thorough documentation, which ensures\nrobust security and sets up the essential foundation for user management.\n\n\nDEVISE MODULES\n\nDevise offers various modules that you can enable to boost the security of your\napplication or cater to specific user management requirements. Here are some of\nthe most commonly employed modules:\n\nCONFIRMABLE\n\nThis module requires users to confirm their registration via email before they\ncan log in, adding a layer of security against spam or bots.\n\nTRACKABLE\n\nTrackable keeps a count of a user's sign-ins and their last signed-in date. This\ndata comes in handy for insight into user activity and managing account\nsecurity.\n\nLOCKABLE\n\nIf there are multiple failed login attempts, this module locks the user account,\nthwarting brute force attacks.\n\nRECOVERABLE\n\nFor users who forget their passwords, Recoverable provides a straightforward\nmechanism for resetting their passwords, usually through a password reset email.\n\nTIMEOUTABLE\n\nTimeoutable helps in automatically logging out users after a certain period of\ninactivity, bolstering security in shared computer environments.\n\nOMNIAUTHABLE\n\nThis module simplifies integration with external authentication providers, such\nas Google or Facebook.\n\nDATABASE AUTHENTICATABLE\n\nThis is the default module and it uses a locally stored password for user\nauthentication.\n\nREGISTABLE\n\nFor user registration, this module provides a straightforward method.\n\n\nSETUP STEPS\n\nTo use Devise in a Rails application, follow these steps:\n\n 1. Add the Gem: Include the devise gem in your Gemfile, followed by a bundle\n    install.\n\n 2. Install Devise: Run the provided Devise installer generator, which sets up\n    configuration files and models pertaining to users.\n\n 3. Model Setup: Modify your User model, if required, to implement various\n    Devise modules and configuration options. Run any specified migrations.\n\n 4. Views and Routes: Devise provides default views and routes, which you might\n    want to customize or explicitly include in your routing setup.\n\n 5. Link to the Root of the App: Ensure that your application root is\n    configured, allowing the user to be redirected to the sign-in screen or the\n    site's root post a successful sign-in.\n\n 6. Safeguard Controlled Actions: You can use the authenticate_user!\n    before_action in your controllers to restrict access only to authenticated\n    users.\n\n 7. Setup Strong Parameters: Ensure that the necessary user parameters are\n    permitted.\n\n 8. Customize: You have the freedom to modify Devise's default controllers or\n    views to fine-tune the experience according to your app's design.\n\n 9. Test: Don't forget the most crucial step of testing your completed solution.\n\n\nABSTENTIONS FROM DEVISE\n\nWhile Devise serves as an optimal choice for most applications, its utilization\nmight be less pertinent in certain scenarios:\n\n * Lightweight Apps: For apps requiring only basic authentication, Devise's\n   robust feature set may feel excessive.\n * Radical Customization: If your application necessitates an unconventional\n   user authentication system, starting from scratch or employing a tailored\n   solution might be preferable over Devise's adaptation.\n * Learn-As-You-Go Approach: While Devise provides exceptional out-of-the-box\n   solutions, if you aim for a deeper comprehension of authentication\n   mechanisms, building your own system might be instructive.\n\n\nRAILS SCAFFOLDING VS. DEVISE\n\nWhile rails generate scaffold is an in-built mechanism catering to data\nmanagement and exposure, Devise is an external library catering exclusively to\nuser authentication.

Refactor Phase: Improve Code Quality\n    \n    * Once the failing test is written and the code is updated to pass, refactor\n      to enhance code readability and structure.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nrequire 'minitest/autorun'\n\nclass StringTest < Minitest::Test\n  def test_string_reversal\n    assert_equal 'tac', reverse('cat')\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nTDD BEST PRACTICES IN RUBY\n\n * Keep Tests Focused: Each test should center on one functionality to ensure\n   clarity and maintainability.\n * Design for Tests: Make your codebase test-friendly by keeping classes and\n   methods concise.\n * Use Assertions Judiciously: Employ the right assertions to cover requisite\n   test conditions.\n * Write Expressive Tests: Use readable test descriptions and clear variable\n   names.\n\n\nTDD TOOLING IN RUBY\n\nThe standard Ruby library comes with test facilities and external ports of JUnit\nexist, like Test/Unit and Minitest.\n\nFor behavioral tests and acceptance testing, consider Cucumber and RSpec.\n\nFor integration tests, WebMock is valuable.\n\nOther general TDD tools for Ruby feature SimpleCov for code coverage, Guard for\nautomation, and VCR for network testing and mocking.\n\nBeyond tools strictly linked to TDD, Ruby also has excellent tools for\ncontinuous integration and deployment, like Travis CI and Jenkins.","index":59,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"61.\n\n\nWHAT IS A MOCK, AND HOW IS IT USED IN TESTING?","answer":"Mocking is a testing technique that helps isolate classes or modules to focus on\nspecific behaviors and interactions.\n\nIn the context of Ruby, the key tool for mocking is the Minitest::Mock library.\n\n\nCORE BENEFITS OF MOCKING\n\n * Isolation: Focusing on individual components streamlines testing, making it\n   easier to detect and resolve issues.\n\n * Controlled Environment: Testing specific behaviors in a controlled setting\n   improves test accuracy and helps pinpoint errors.\n\n * Efficiency: Mocks allow selective testing, potentially saving time and\n   computational resources.\n\n\nSTEPS FOR IMPLEMENTING MOCKING\n\n 1. Create a Mock Object: Instantiate a mock object, defining expected behavior\n    and setting any necessary constraints.\n\n 2. Alter Context with the Mock: Modify the test context to utilize the mock\n    object instead of the real class.\n\n 3. Invoke and Verify: Execute the code that interacts with the mocked object\n    and confirm that the expected interactions took place.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE FOR MOCKING IN RUBY\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\n# Original Connection class\n\nclass ExternalService\n  def call_api\n    # Make API call\n  end\nend\n\n# Test for a class that relies on ExternalService\n\nrequire 'minitest/autorun'\n\nclass MyClassTest < Minitest::Test\n  def test_api_call\n    # Create a mock for the external service\n    mock_service = Minitest::Mock.new\n    mock_service.expect(:call_api, { status: 200 }, [])  # Expect call_api to be called once with no arguments\n\n    # Inject the mock instead of the real service\n    MyClass.stub :new, -> { |service| service.call_api } do\n      assert_equal { status: 200 }, MyClass.serve_api(mock_service)\n    end\n\n    # Verify the expected interaction\n    mock_service.verify\n  end\nend\n","index":60,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"62.\n\n\nDESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNIT TESTS AND INTEGRATION TESTS.","answer":"In the context of Ruby and other programming languages, it is important to be\nparticularly attentive to unit testing and integration testing.\n\n\nUNIT TESTING\n\nUnit tests examine individual components of the code, typically classes and\nmethods, in isolation. They verify that functions and methods handle specific\nscenarios and input/output cases correctly. Mocks and stubs are often used to\nisolate the unit under test from its dependencies.\n\nWHY UNIT TESTS?\n\nUnit tests have several advantages:\n\n * Rapid Execution: They are often the quickest tests to run due to their\n   singular focus.\n * Clear Responsibility: They pinpoint exactly which component of code is\n   causing a failure.\n * Reduced Complexity: By focusing on small units, they are easier to write and\n   maintain.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: UNIT TEST\n\nHere is the RSpec test:\n\n# spec/calculator_spec.rb\n\nRSpec.describe Calculator do\n  describe \"#add\" do\n    it \"adds two numbers\" do\n      calculator = Calculator.new\n      result = calculator.add(3, 5)\n      expect(result).to eq(8)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR UNIT TESTS\n\n * Dependency Isolation: Use mocks and stubs to prevent the test from relying on\n   other components.\n * One Assumption per Test: Each test should focus on one expected outcome.\n * Descriptive Names: Use clear, descriptive names for your tests.\n\n\nINTEGRATION TESTING\n\nIntegration tests assess whether different parts of the system (units) work\ntogether effectively. The aim is to detect issues that surface when modules are\ncombined and ensure they collaborate as anticipated.\n\nWHY INTEGRATION TESTS?\n\nIntegration tests come in handy for:\n\n * Spotting Interface Mismatches: They reveal incompatibilities when multiple\n   units connect.\n * Cutting Redundancy: By detecting duplicated functionalities in units, they\n   aid in eliminating redundancy.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: INTEGRATION TEST\n\nHere is the RSpec test:\n\n# spec/integration/user_management_spec.rb\n\nRSpec.describe \"User Management\" do\n  it \"allows user to register, login, and view profile\" do\n    # Setup: Create a new user and ensure the user form is valid\n    user = User.new(username: \"testuser\", password: \"password\")\n    expect(user.valid?).to be(true)\n    \n    # Exercise: Save the user, simulate logging in, and fetch the profile\n    user.save\n    logged_in = user.login\n    profile = user.profile\n    \n    # Verify whether everything worked as expected\n    expect(logged_in).to be(true)\n    expect(profile).to_not be_nil\n  end\nend\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR INTEGRATION TESTS\n\n * Independent Scenarios: Each test should be autonomous and not reliant on the\n   results of others.\n * Model Realistic User Behaviour: Rather than imitating individual components,\n   simulate user interactions.\n\n\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE\n\nBoth types of tests are essential for ensuring quality. A balanced approach is\noften a good practice:\n\n 1. Start with Unit Tests: Guarantee that each method, class, or module resides\n    as expected in isolation.\n 2. Complement with Integration Tests: Confirm that different components\n    collaborate effectively in real-world scenarios.","index":61,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"63.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU OPTIMIZE RUBY CODE FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE?","answer":"Ruby is known for its readability and ease of use, but isn't always the first\nchoice for performance-critical systems.

However, due to the Global Interpreter\nLock (GIL), a unique limitation exists where only one thread can execute Ruby\ncode at a time. This doesn't prevent threads from being useful, but it limits\ntheir potential for parallel processing.\n\n\nTHREAD CLASS\n\nThe Thread class in Ruby makes dealing with threads more manageable than working\nwith native threads in other languages, such as C++ or Java.\n\nCORE FUNCTIONALITIES\n\n 1. Initialization: Threads are created by calling Thread.new and passing a\n    block of code or a reference to a method.\n\n 2. Joining: With the join method, one thread can wait for another to complete,\n    akin to waiting for a process in a multi-process scenario.\n\n 3. Yielding Control: The pass method allows threads to give up their remaining\n    time slice to other threads, similar to yielding in non-threaded code.\n\n 4. Execution: Ruby's threads allow for execution suspension, resumption, and\n    termination.\n\n 5. Safety Mechanism: If not explicitly managed, Ruby threads can terminate when\n    the main program ends.\n\n 6. Access to main Thread: The main thread can be accessed using the main\n    method.\n\n 7. Thread Local Variables: Threads can have their own variables, separate from\n    the main program and other threads. This behavior can be beneficial for\n    storing thread-specific data.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: MULTI-THREADED URL FETCH\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nrequire 'net/http'  # For URL fetching\n\nurls = [\n  URI('https://www.google.com/'), \n  URI('https://www.wikipedia.org/'), \n  URI('https://www.ruby-lang.org/')\n]\n\nthreads = []\n\nurls.each do |url|\n  threads << Thread.new do\n    res = Net::HTTP.get(url)\n    puts \"#{url} - #{res.length} bytes\"\n  end\nend\n\nthreads.each(&:join)  # Wait for all threads to finish\n","index":66,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"68.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE GLOBAL INTERPRETER LOCK (GIL) IN RUBY?","answer":"The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism in Ruby that permits only one\nthread to execute Ruby code at a time.

Still, it\n   doesn't significantly enhance threaded I/O operations.\n\n * Thread Safety: Simplifies the development of C extensions and ensures Ruby\n   data structures remain thread-safe even when shared across threads.\n\n\nGIL LIMITATIONS\n\nThe GIL introduces some limitations to multi-threading in Ruby:\n\n * CPU-Bound Tasks: Multiple threads are hindered in their ability to\n   efficiently utilize multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n * I/O Operations: While the GIL doesn't interrupt I/O operations, threads\n   aren't optimally utilized for I/O-bound tasks.\n\n * Memory Management: Although the GIL simplifies memory management, it can lead\n   to bottlenecks in heavy memory operations.\n\n\nGIL IN OTHER RUBY IMPLEMENTATIONS\n\nDifferent Ruby implementations, like JRuby and Rubinius, don't utilize GIL.\nInstead, they rely on finer-grained thread management, better suited for modern\nmulti-core systems.\n\n\nDOES IT IMPACT ALL RUBY ELEMENTS?\n\nNot all Ruby operations are subject to the GIL. For example, C extensions can\nsneak past the GIL to execute multi-threaded code, potentially leading to thread\ncontentions within an extension.\nSparse GIL influence is also observable in certain I/O operations like network\nand file I/O, which can run independently of the GIL.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: EXPLORING THE GIL IN RUBY\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nrequire 'benchmark'\n\n# A method that simulates CPU-bound tasks\ndef cpu_bound_task\n  10_000_000.times do\n    14 * 27\n  end\nend\n\n# Create multiple threads to observe GIL limitations\ndef thread_task(example)\n  threads = []\n  \n  3.times do\n    threads << Thread.new { cpu_bound_task }\n  end\n  \n  threads.each(&:join)\nend\n\n# Benchmark the threaded vs. non-threaded CPU tasks\nBenchmark.bm(10) do |x|\n  x.report('Single-threaded:') { cpu_bound_task }\n  x.report('Multi-threaded:') { thread_task }\nend\n","index":67,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"69.\n\n\nHOW DO THREADS WORK IN RUBY, AND WHEN SHOULD YOU USE THEM?","answer":"Ruby is equipped with built-in threading, capable of performing concurrent\noperations.

The Garbage Collector (GC) ensures efficient memory allocation\nand reclamation, but its activities can affect performance.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\nVIRTUAL MACHINE (VM)\n\nRuby, like many interpreted languages, runs within a VM. The VM manages memory\nand executes bytecode, enabling platform-agnostic performance.\n\nOBJECTS AND REFERENCES\n\nRuby is an object-oriented language, where everything is an object. These\nobjects are dynamically allocated on the heap and accessed via references.\n\n * A reference points to an object on the heap.\n * Assigning or passing objects as function parameters only deals with\n   references, not the objects themselves. This is known as pass-by-reference.\n\nMEMORY MANAGEMENT\n\nRuby abstracts away manual memory management, providing a garbage collection\nmechanism for automatic memory cleanup.\n\nCopy-on-Write: When forking a process, Ruby uses a \"copy-on-write\" strategy to\noptimize memory use. Until a process attempts to modify a shared memory region,\nthe VM and its memory remain shared with the forking parent process.\n\n\nGARBAGE COLLECTION\n\nRuby employs a tri-generational garbage collector, which means it classifies\nobjects into three generations based on their age (how many GC cycles they've\nsurvived) and adapts the collection frequency and method for each generation.\n\nTUNING\n\nIn recent versions, Ruby has become better at self-tuning its GC for general\nworkloads. However, there are advanced techniques to fine-tune the GC:\n\n * Diagnostics: Tools like GC.stat provide various statistics.\n * Explicit Invocations: Direct controls like GC.start to start a manual garbage\n   collection cycle are available.\n\nIMPACT ON PERFORMANCE\n\nWhile automatic memory management is convenient, the GC's activities can come\nwith performance costs, especially in the case of large heaps or real-time\nsystems with stringent latency requirements.\n\nTypical performance-related activities include:\n\nPause Times: During GC, especially for the older generations, the VM may pause\nexecution, leading to potential latency spikes.\n\nCPU Utilization: The actual GC process can consume CPU resources, which might\ndetract from application processing.\n\nMemory Fragmentation: Over time, especially with long-lived processes,\nfragmentation can occur.

This is achieved\nprimarily through a combination of method look-up mechanisms and dynamic method\ndefinition and invocation techniques.\n\n\nMETHOD LOOK-UP MECHANISMS\n\n 1. Self Determines the Target of the Invocation: The self context is pivotal\n    for method resolution. Depending on the type of self and the presence or\n    absence of the method in the inheritance chain, method look-up is adjusted.\n\n 2. Method Search Path: The inheritance chain, known as the \"method look-up\n    path,\" is constructed using modules and classes, and it determines the order\n    in which methods are looked up.\n    \n    Ruby 3.0 introduced a separate, more efficient method look-up mechanism for\n    classes that don't include many modules, to optimize the common case.\n\n 3. Method Tables: Each Ruby object, as a part of its meta-programming features,\n    maintains a table of methods known as a method dispatch cache. This table is\n    leveraged during method calls for quicker look-ups.\n    \n    This mechanism was introduced to address the inefficiency stemming from the\n    need to traverse the entire method look-up chain for every method call.\n\n\nDYNAMIC METHOD DEFINITION AND INVOCATION TECHNIQUES\n\n 1. Method Aliasing: Ruby allows for method aliasing, where a method can have\n    multiple names. This enables different methods to refer to the same\n    underlying functionality, allowing for flexibility in method invocation.\n\n 2. Singleton Method Definition: Ruby permits the definition of methods for a\n    single instance of a class or object. This provides a dynamic way to\n    introduce methods, expanding an object's capabilities at run-time.\n    \n    In Ruby, classes are also objects, allowing them to have singleton methods.\n    This feature affords a flexible means for altering an individual class,\n    distinct from its standard behavior and impacting only the specific class\n    instance.\n\n 3. Method Missing: When a method call is made, but the target object doesn't\n    possess a matching method, Ruby resorts to a callback mechanism called\n    method_missing. This gives objects the opportunity to handle the method call\n    in a customized way, enabling tasks like dynamic attribute handling and\n    method delegation.\n    \n    It's essential to note that overuse of method_missing can introduce\n    ambiguity and complicate code maintenance and comprehension.\n\nThe combination of these features equips Ruby with a highly adaptable and\nloose-coupling method invocation mechanism, making the language well-suited for\ntasks that demand ad-hoc method definitions and precise method look-up paths.","index":79,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"81.\n\n\nDESCRIBE HOW TO USE METHOD_MISSING FOR HANDLING UNDEFINED METHODS.","answer":"method_missing is a powerful Ruby mechanism that allows handling of undefined\nmethods in an intuitive way.

Consequently, it might be best to use it for infrequent,\n   dynamic method calls.\n * Visibility and Inheritance: Private methods aren't accessible through\n   method_missing. Furthermore, it affects inheritance bounds.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Documentation and Potential Fallback: It is crucial to provide clear\n   documentation when using method_missing to inform other developers about its\n   presence.

You can add or\n   remove methods from an object at runtime, facilitating flexibility in your\n   code.\n\n * Adaptability: For instances where you need a method to be unique to a\n   specific instance of a class, metaclasses serve the purpose.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: METACLASSES\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nclass Bird\n   def self.fly\n      return \"I am flying high\"\n   end\nend\n\np Bird.fly    # I am flying high   \n\np Bird.methods.grep /fly/    # [:fly]\np Bird.class.methods.grep /fly/    # [:fly]\np Bird.singleton_class.methods.grep /fly/    # [:fly]\n","index":82,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"84.\n\n\nHOW IS THE 'FORK' OPERATION USED IN RUBY?","answer":"In Ruby, the fork operation allows a process to create a copy of itself. This\nmethod is especially powerful when used in combination with UNIX system calls\nfor enhanced functionality.\n\nThe child and parent processes your code creates don't share any memory updates\nor operations. Instead, they each have a copy of the original process's state\nfrozen at the time of forking. Any changes they make don't affect the other\nprocess.\n\n\nUSE CASES\n\n * Parallelism: Forking enables parallel execution where each process has its\n   own independent tasks.\n * High-Performance Computing: It's a foundation for message passing in systems\n   like MPI.\n * Error Recovery: Especially in long-running programs, forking can be used to\n   recover from unhandled errors.\n\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLES\n\n * Running Commands: The child process can take over and execute separate\n   commands using exec.\n * Worker Creation: In systems like web servers, forking is used to create\n   multiple child worker processes to handle client requests.\n\n\nRESTRICTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS\n\n * State Isolation: The parent and child processes have separate memory spaces,\n   preventing easy communication or sharing of data.\n * Active Library Handles: If a process has open file handles or other active\n   resources, the child process will inherit those. This can cause unexpected\n   results or leaks unless handled correctly.\n * Thread Precautions: Ruby's fork isn't thread-safe.

It's essential for tasks like\ncoordinating input/output operations and enabling multi-user systems.\n\nParallelism, on the other hand, focuses on simultaneously running multiple tasks\nor parts of tasks to speed up execution, commonly by leveraging multiple CPU\ncores or separate machines.\n\n\nRELATED CONCEPTS\n\n * Multithreading: Threads are the smallest sequence of programmed instructions\n   that can be managed independently. Multithreading enables tasks to run\n   concurrently.\n\n * Multiprocessing: In contrast to multithreading, multiprocessing achieves\n   parallelism by creating multiple processes, each existing in its memory\n   space. This approach is often employed to harness multiple CPU cores.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONCURRENCY AND I/O\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nrequire 'open-uri'\nrequire 'thread'\n\nurls = [\"https://url1.com\", \"https://url2.com\", \"https://url3.com\"]\nqueue = Queue.new\n\nurls.each { |url| queue << url }\n\nworkers = (0...5).map do\n  Thread.new do\n    begin\n      while (url = queue.pop(true))\n        puts open(url).read\n      end\n    rescue ThreadError\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nworkers.each(&:join)\n\n\nIn this example, a separate thread is created to handle each URL, and by virtue\nof concurrency, the script can initiate I/O operations while processing other\ntasks.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE CONCURRENCY AND PARALLELISM\n\n * Concurrency Use Cases: Best suited for tasks where resources must be\n   efficiently utilized while I/O is performed, like serving web requests and\n   managing user interfaces.\n\n * Parallelism Use Cases: Ideal for compute-intensive tasks, such as large-scale\n   data processing and machine learning, where subdividing tasks across multiple\n   cores optimizes speed.","index":84,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"86.\n\n\nWHAT ARE MUTEXES AND HOW DO THEY WORK IN RUBY?","answer":"A Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one\nthread at a time can execute a critical section of code, assisting in avoiding\nrace conditions.\n\nIn Ruby, Mutex is primarily used in multi-threading to manage access to shared\nresources.\n\n\nKEY FUNCTIONS\n\n * Mutex.new: Initializes a new Mutex.\n\n * synchronize: Provides a convenient way to ensure unimpeded access to a\n   critical section.

The method's syntax is:\n\nreadable, writable, error_io = IO.select(read_array, write_array, error_array, timeout)\n\n\nWhere:\n\n * read_array, write_array, and error_array contain I/O objects to monitor.\n * timeout is an optional time limit in seconds.\n\n\nMANAGING TIMERS\n\nRuby doesn't have built-in support for timers in IO.select. Yet, you can\nmitigate this through creative coding.\n\nYou can use Kernel#sleep inside a loop to wait for a specific time or even\nperiodically check a condition.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nstart_time = Time.now\ntimeout = 5  # in seconds\n\nloop do\n  current_time = Time.now\n  elapsed_time = current_time - start_time\n\n  break if elapsed_time >= timeout\n\n  sleep_for = [timeout - elapsed_time, 0.1].min  # sleep for at most 0.1s\n  sleep(sleep_for)\nend\n\n# Continue with your code after timeout\n\n\nFor more advanced timer management or for those heavily leaning on asynchronous\npatterns, employing a more specialized library, specifically designed for\nasynchronous timer operations, could be advantageous.\n\n\nGUARDING AGAINST STARVATION\n\nRuby 2.5 and higher versions improve IO.select's behavior by adopting a fairer\nscheduling policy. This helps mitigate the potential issue of certain I/O\nsources not receiving attention, particularly in high-load scenarios.\nNonetheless, it's always wise to design your application considering such\npossibilities.\n\n\nCONTEXT BEYOND EVENT LOOPS\n\nWhile event-driven systems, with their dedicated loops to manage all\nasynchronous activities, embody an elegant design, they might place greater\ncognitive and infrastructural demands, especially when you're bridging these\nparadigms with other application components.

Great for\n   dealing with content types, authentication, and more:\n   \n   request.add_field('Authorization', 'Bearer token')\n   \n\n * Request Body Management:\n   \n   * For POST and PUT requests, you can attach data to the request body using\n     either the request_body parameter or the request object:\n   \n   # Using `request_body` parameter\n   response = http.post(url, data, request_body)\n   \n   # Configuring the `request` object\n   request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(url)\n   request.body = data\n   response = http.request(request)\n   \n\nAn established practice is using shortcut methods such as post_form for a POST\nData-Url-Encoded request or get_response and post in case of handling simple\nrequests. These methods streamline creation and sending of requests without\ncompromising on control and customization.\n\n\nHANDLING RESPONSES\n\n * Status Codes:\n   \n   * Requests return a Net::HTTPResponse object.

Gemfile: Add Sequel and the appropriate database adapter to your Gemfile:\n    \n    gem 'sequel'\n    gem 'sqlite3'  # For SQLite, replace with the adapter you need\n    \n\n 2. Bundle Install: Execute the following command in your terminal:\n    \n    bundle install\n    \n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SQLITE USING SEQUEL\n\nBelow is the Ruby code:\n\nrequire 'sequel'\n\n# Establish a SQLite connection\nDB = Sequel.sqlite('mydatabase.db')\n\n# Define a model\nclass Teacher < Sequel::Model(DB[:teachers])\nend\n\n# Perform a query\nteacher = Teacher.first\nputs teacher.name\n\n\n\nUNDER THE HOOD\n\n * Backend Support: Sequel has built-in support for a multitude of database\n   systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\n\n * Power-Packed Features: It offers a variety of advanced features, such as\n   dataset filtering, eager loading, and associations. These are implemented in\n   similar ways across different database backends, making the development\n   process more consistent.\n\n * Lazy Evaluation: Queries aren't executed immediately. Instead, they are\n   deferred until the point when their results are actually required. This\n   approach improves performance by preventing redundant queries.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Scoped Databases: For specific connections, consider creating isolated\n   database objects. This ensures that operations and queries don't\n   inadvertently affect unrelated code. For example:\n   \n   db = Sequel.sqlite('mydatabase.db')\n   \n\n * Connection Pooling: Many database systems, like PostgreSQL or MySQL, offer\n   built-in mechanisms to manage a pool of connections. While Sequel doesn't\n   handle connection pooling itself, it supports advanced options for databases\n   that provide it. Ensure you configure the pool size according to your\n   application's needs.\n\n * Consistency in Error Handling: Standardize your approach to error handling to\n   ensure uniformity across database interactions. This might involve utilizing\n   methods like fetch inside of Sequel::Model, accompanied by a rescue clause.\n\n * Data Integrity: Enforce data integrity at the application level. Sequel, by\n   default, doesn't apply advanced constraints like NOT NULL or UNIQUE when\n   creating tables automatically. This level of control can be an advantage if\n   employed judiciously.\n\n\nADVANCED FEATURES\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nUse transactions to guarantee that a series of operations either all succeed or\nall fail, avoiding states where some changes are applied while others are not.\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nDB.transaction do\n  # Perform multiple changes together\nend\n\n\nUNIONS\n\nCombine the results of multiple queries using unions. This tool is perfect for\naggregating data from different sources.\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\ncombined_results = DB[:teachers].select(:name).union(DB[:students].select(:name))\n","index":97,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"99.\n\n\nEXPLAIN ORM IN THE CONTEXT OF RUBY.","answer":"ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in a Ruby context involves translating between\nRelational Databases and Object-Oriented Ruby code.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\nMAPPINGS\n\n * Table-to-Class: Each table in the database represents an associated Ruby\n   class.\n * Column-to-Attribute: Table columns correspond to named attributes in Ruby\n   classes. This 1-to-1 relationship facilitates easy attribute access and\n   modification.\n\nQUERY LANGUAGE\n\n * Simplified Database Interactions: ORM libraries streamline database\n   operations. For instance, Active Record distills these operations into\n   intuitive methods.\n * Abstracted SQL: ORM libraries generally allow easy construction of database\n   queries without exposing developers to raw SQL.\n\nRELATIONSHIPS\n\n * Associations: ORM systems often provide a natural way of representing links\n   between database tables. This helps maintain the integrity of relationships\n   between objects.\n\n * Optimization: Some ORM systems use techniques like eager loading to improve\n   query performance.\n   \n   \n   CODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nclass Author < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :books\nend\n\nclass Book < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :author\nend\n","index":98,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"100.\n\n\nWHAT ARE DB MIGRATIONS, AND HOW WOULD YOU MANAGE THEM IN A RUBY CONTEXT?","answer":"Database migrations enable easier handling of database changes. This process\ninvolves transforming data from one version to another while keeping the data\nintegrity intact.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Change Tracking: Versions and changes are tracked in a database table.\n\n * SQL Automation: Migrations automatically run SQL queries based on the\n   requested changes.\n\n * Reverse Operations: Many migration frameworks support downgrades in addition\n   to upgrades.\n\n\nDEFAULT TOOL IN RUBY: ACTIVE RECORD MIGRATIONS\n\nRuby on Rails includes the ActiveRecord framework, providing a powerful tool for\nmanaging database changes.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Version Tracking: Migrations are versioned, and ActiveRecord maintains a\n   record of which migrations have been run.\n\n * Integrated Commands: Developers can run commands like rake db:migrate to\n   apply pending migrations.\n\n * Schema Dump: The current state of the database schema can be pre-determined\n   and generated.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: ACTIVERECORD MIGRATION\n\nHere is the Ruby code:\n\nclass AddPartNumberToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]\n  def change\n    add_column :products, :part_number, :string\n  end\nend\n\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN\n\n 1. The class name follows a specific convention: AddPartNumberToProducts is the\n    migration's name. It inherits from ActiveRecord::Migration.\n\n 2. The method change encapsulates the operation. In this instance, it adds a\n    column to the products table.\n\n 3. The file containing this migration would be named\n    timestamp_add_part_number_to_products.rb.\n\n\nADVANCED FEATURES\n\n * Schema & Data Changes: Migrations can include both structural modifications\n   (like adding/removing tables) and data transformations.\n\n * Safety Checks: Some systems, like ActiveRecord, provide reversible migrations\n   and other developer-friendly features to prevent accidental data loss.\n\n * Migration Rollbacks: Developers can reverse specific migrations in certain\n   scenarios.\n\n * Migration Generators: Tools like Rails generators can create migrations\n   automatically, streamlining the development process.\n\nPOTENTIAL PITFALLS\n\n * Edge Cases: While migrations help in most cases, some complex changes might\n   still require manual handling.\n\n * Data Loss Risk: Developers need to be cautious, especially when making\n   changes that can affect existing data.\n\n * Distributed Development: When many developers work independently,\n   communicating about and managing concurrent migrations is crucial.\n\n * Codebase Changes: As migrations are tied to the codebase, deploying schema\n   changes across different environments could become complicated.","index":99,"topic":" Ruby ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
