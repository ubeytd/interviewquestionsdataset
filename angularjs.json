It is specifically designed to overcome challenges in\nSingle-Page Applications (SPAs) development.\n\n\nCORE FEATURES\n\nMODULAR\n\nAngularJS structures applications into distinct modules, facilitating modular\ndevelopment and easy maintenance.\n\nTWO-WAY DATA BINDING\n\nData changes in the Model (back-end) or the View (front-end) automatically\nupdate the other.\n\nDEPENDENCY INJECTION\n\nThis design pattern makes components independent by injecting dependencies from\nexternal sources rather than hard-coding them.\n\nDIRECTIVES\n\nThey are markers in the DOM that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler to attach a\nspecific behavior to the DOM element or to transform the DOM element and its\nchildren.\n\nTEMPLATES & DATA BINDING\n\nAngularJS leverages templates that combine HTML with AngularJS directives and\nexpressions for dynamic content. The framework offers sophisticated data binding\nto keep the UI and app data in sync.\n\nRESTFUL API INTERACTION\n\nAngularJS simplifies communication with RESTful APIs, making it easy to work\nwith server-side data.\n\nMVC ARCHITECTURE\n\nAngularJS embraces the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which helps\nin organizing code into modular, testable, and maintainable units.\n\nADVANCED ROUTING\n\nThe framework supports advanced routing capabilities, enabling a multi-view\nlayout by defining the route for each view.\n\nSERVICES\n\nAngularJS facilitates the creation of reusable business logic units using\nservices. These units encapsulate specific tasks and can be injected where\nneeded.\n\nEXTENSIVE TESTING\n\nBuilt-in support for unit testing allows components to be tested in isolation,\naiding in bug detection and rapid iteration.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY LIBRARY INTEGRATION\n\nAngularJS readily integrates with third-party libraries such as Bootstrap and\njQuery.\n\nCROSS-PLATFORM AND CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY\n\nThe framework, adhering to web standards, offers consistent behavior across\nplatforms and browsers.\n\nDATA VALIDATION\n\nAngularJS simplifies the process of form validation through its built-in\ndirectives and services.\n\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS WITH VERSIONS\n\nAs the framework progresses from AngularJS to Angular, later versions offer\nenhancements in performance, developer experience, and security.\n\n\nCONSISTENT DATA HANDLING\n\nAngularJS maintains a unidirectional flow of data and has mechanisms in place to\nmanage state, ensuring data accuracy and minimizing unexpected behaviors.\n\n\nLIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT\n\nComponents in AngularJS go through a consistent lifecycle: creation, rendering,\nupdates, and eventual destruction. This lifecycle management allows for targeted\noperations at various stages.\n\n\nPRE-BUILD OPTIMIZATION\n\nDevelopers can enhance AngularJS applications using tools like Ahead-of-Time\n(AOT) compilation, which optimizes performance by moving logic and templates to\noffline, pre-compiled files.","index":0,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"2.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF TWO-WAY DATA BINDING IN ANGULARJS.","answer":"Two-way data binding in AngularJS ensures that model changes automatically\nreflect in the view, and vice versa.\n\nWhen a model or the input field value in UI gets updated, AngularJS instantly\nreflects the changes both ways. It essentially acts as a bridge, allowing\nseamless synchronization between the model and view in near real-time.\n\n\nDETAILED WORKFLOW\n\n 1. Initial Data: The data originates from the model and populates the view,\n    providing users with initial values or content.\n\n 2. View Modification: When a user interacts with the UI, such as modifying an\n    input field or selecting an option, AngularJS instantly updates the\n    associated model.\n\n 3. Model Changes: These model adjustments, occurring in real-time, are then\n    immediately updated in both model and view, aligning the two components.\n\n 4. Validation and Coercion: Inputs are also validated and optionally coerced.\n    \n    * When a user input contradicts data type expectations or fails validation\n      rules, AngularJS can correct or validate it, ensuring data integrity.\n\n 5. View Update: The now-validated or coerced data returns to the view,\n    empowering users with visual feedback on any adjustments or corrections.\n\nThe entire two-way data binding cycle ensures an instantaneous, synchronized\nrelationship between the model and the UI. This feature significantly lowers the\nneed for manual DOM manipulation or event handling.","index":1,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"3.\n\n\nWHAT ARE DIRECTIVES IN ANGULARJS?

They encompass JS\nfunctions, DOM elements, and even comment elements.\n\n\nCORE DIRECTIVES\n\n * ngApp: Defines the root element of the AngularJS application.\n\n * ngController: Associates the controller with a section of the view.\n\n * ngModel: Links an HTML element such as an input, select or textarea to a\n   property on the scope.\n\n * ngBind: Binds the innerHTML of the element to the expression.\n\n * ngBindHtml: For DOM-based XSS protection, binds innerHTML to the expression\n   after sanitizing it.\n\n * ngBindTemplate: Used for inline templates.\n\n * ngClick: Executes custom behavior on a click event.\n\n * Validation Directives: AngularJS offers two types of field validation\n   attributes:\n\n 1. Regular HTML5 Validation Attributes\n    \n    AngularJS sets up the appropriate validation properties on the model using\n    the following HTML5 attributes:\n    \n    * required\n    * min\n    * max\n    * minlength\n    * maxlength\n    * pattern\n\n 2. Custom Validation Directives\n    \n    You can build these custom directives to suit specific requirements. Common\n    examples are:\n    \n    * match\n    * unique-email\n\n\nEVENT DIRECTIVES\n\nThese directives react to particular DOM events:\n\n * ngBlur and ngFocus: Used to detect element focus or blur.\n\n * ngChange: Triggers when the associated model is changed.\n\nOTHERS\n\nThe library supports more specific ones like ngCut, ngCopy, ngPaste.\n\n\nSTYLING AND CLASS DIRECTIVES\n\nThese directives dynamically alter CSS classes and inline styles:\n\n * ngClass : switches classes based on object states.\n * ngStyle : dynamically applies inline styles.\n\n\nINTEGRATION DIRECTIVES\n\nAngularJS aligns with other libraries through integration directives:\n\n * ngIf : conditionally includes an element.\n * ngSwitch : operates like a switch statement.\n * ngRepeat : loops over arrays and objects.\n\n\nFORMS INTEGRATION\n\nAngularJS extends form behavior with:\n\n * ngForm : groups form controls.\n\n * ngSubmit : binds to the submit method of a form.\n\n * ngOptions : dynamically populates select elements.\n\n\nTEMPLATE HANDLING DIRECTIVES\n\n * ngInclude : fetches, compiles and includes an external HTML fragment into the\n   directive element.\n\n * ngView : sets up a consistent mechanism for multiple views in a Single Page\n   Application (SPA).\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS DIRECTIVES AND INTERACTIONS\n\n * ngClassEven and ngClassOdd : Simplify zebra striping.\n\n * ngCsp : Essential in Content Security Policy protection.\n\n * ngPluralize : Optimizes pluralization for different languages.","index":2,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"4.\n\n\nHOW DOES THE ANGULARJS DIGEST CYCLE WORK FOR DATA BINDING?","answer":"The AngularJS Digest Cycle is responsible for managing two-way data binding,\nkeeping the View and Model synchronized. The cycle usually runs automatically\nbut can be triggered manually in certain cases.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n 1. Watchers: These are functions that observe changes in the model, ensuring\n    the View is updated accordingly.\n 2. Dirty-Checking: Angular performs this by comparing the current state of data\n    (the \"new\" state) with the previous state (the \"old\" state). If there's a\n    discrepancy, the system flags the data as \"dirty\", indicating a change\n    requiring action.\n 3. $watch: This directive is used to track changes in model properties,\n    although it should be used judiciously as excessive $watcher creation can\n    negatively impact app performance.\n\n\nMANUAL TRIGGER MECHANISM\n\nEven though Angular aptly manages the Digest Cycle, developers can manually\ninitiate it as well. This can be useful in cases where the Cycle does not\ntrigger automatically.\n\nTo do this, you can use:\n\n * $scope.$apply(): This tells Angular that a part of the code (a function or\n   code block) was executed outside of its context and changes might have\n   occurred. Consequently, it forces a two-way data binding sync. However, this\n   typically triggers the complete Digest Cycle, which might lead to performance\n   issues if used in high-frequency contexts.\n\n * $scope.$digest(): Instead of initiating a complete Digest Cycle, you can\n   specify to sync only certain portions. This method runs the Digest Cycle on\n   the current scope and its children, stopping if no changes are detected.\n\n\nTHE DIGEST LOOP MECHANISM\n\nAngular initiates the Digest Cycle in response to various events, like user\nactions or asynchronous activities. The process essentially involves two steps:\nchange detection and view updating.\n\n 1. Change Detection: Identify alterations in the data. Angular does this by\n    continuously comparing the current state with the previous state, flagging\n    any discrepancies.\n\n 2. View Update: If changes are detected, update the View to reflect the new\n    state. Angular ensures these updates are efficient and minimized to only the\n    affected portions, optimizing application performance.\n\nThe Digest Cycle continues iteratively until:\n\n * It encounters a stable state where no further changes are detected.\n * It reaches maximum iteration counts, after which it throws an error,\n   indicating a possible problem in the code.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: THE DIGEST CYCLE IN ACTION\n\nBelow is the AngularJS code that demonstrates the Digest Cycle with ng-click and\nmanual control using $digest:\n\n\nANGULARJS CODE EXAMPLE: DIGEST CYCLE\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<title>Digest Cycle</title>\n\t<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body ng-app=\"digestApp\" ng-controller=\"digestCtrl\">\n\t<h1>{{ title }}</h1>\n\t<p>Click count: {{ clickCount }}</p>\n\t<button ng-click=\"incrementCount()\">Click me</button>\n</body>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\tvar app = angular.module('digestApp', []);\n\n\tapp.controller('digestCtrl', function($scope) {\n\t\t$scope.title = 'Digest Cycle Example';\n\t\t$scope.clickCount = 0;\n\n\t\t$scope.incrementCount = function() {\n\t\t\t$scope.clickCount++;\n\t\t\t// Manually trigger the Digest Cycle after incrementing the click count\n\t\t\t$scope.$digest();\n\t\t};\n\t});\n</script>\n</html>\n\n\nIn this example, with each button click, we trigger $scope.incrementCount() to\nincrement the click count and force a manual Digest Cycle with $scope.$digest().\nBe aware that the manual initiation might not always be appropriate and can\npotentially lead to performance issues if not handled carefully.","index":3,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nWHAT IS SCOPE IN ANGULARJS, AND HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE JAVASCRIPT SCOPE?","answer":"Scope in AngularJS and JavaScript serve analogous purposes but differ in several\naspects.\n\n\nANGULARJS SCOPE AND JAVASCRIPT SCOPE\n\nDistinction AngularJS Scope JavaScript Scope Scope Creation Automatically\nestablished for each controller Manually created with each function Initiation\nControl Programmatic declaration in a controller Unpredictable scope setup can\nsometimes lead to issues Hierarchical Structure Forms parent-child relationship\nin views Unidirectional from inner to outer functions Scope Prototyping Inherits\nmethod childScope.prototype = parentScope; Does not inherit prototype chains\nDefinition Isolation Local to the controller and its views Global by default;\nlocal when using functions Scope Destruction Control Automatic disposal on\ncontroller exit Garbage collection for variables with no references\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ANGULARJS SCOPE\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n// Controller 1\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl1', function($scope) {\n   $scope.message = \"Hello from Ctrl1!\";\n});\n\n// Controller 2\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl2', function($scope) {\n   console.log($scope.message);  // This will output \"Hello from Ctrl1!\"\n   $scope.message = \"Hello from Ctrl2!\";\n});\n\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n// Controller 1\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl1', function($scope) {\n   $scope.message = \"Hello from Ctrl1!\";\n});\n\n// Controller 2\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl2', function($scope) {\n   console.log($scope.message);  // This will output \"Hello from Ctrl1!\"\n   $scope.message = \"Hello from Ctrl2!\";\n});\n","index":4,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"6.\n\n\nDEFINE WHAT A CONTROLLER IS IN ANGULARJS.","answer":"In AngularJS, the controller is a core component that manages data interaction\nand mediates between the view and the model.\n\nIt's responsible for initializing the state of the $scope, binding model to the\nview, and handling any user interactions.\n\nThe controller's primary role is to initialize the $scope object, which acts as\nthe glue between the controller and the view HTML.\n\n\nKEY CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n 1. Managing Scope: The controller defines what part of the model should be\n    exposed to the view by attaching properties and functions to the $scope\n    object.\n\n 2. Data Handling: It mediates data operations, such as fetching initial data,\n    processing input, and updating the model.\n\n 3. Event Handling: The controller handles both view-specific DOM events and\n    custom events \\(using `$emit` and `$broadcast` to communicate upwards or\n    downwards through the scope hierarchy, respectively\\).\n\n 4. Code Encapsulation: Encloses data and behavior, limiting the exposure to the\n    global state where other components can also access it.\n\n 5. Lifecycle Management: Conducts cleanup tasks during specific stages of the\n    component's lifecycle, such as removing event listeners or unsubscribing\n    from observables.\n\n 6. Service Integration: It collaborates with various AngularJS services such as\n    $http for making HTTP requests or $q for asynchronous operations.\n\n\nENTRY POINT : NG-CONTROLLER\n\nEvery controller in AngularJS is associated with an HTML element via the\nng-controller directive, specifying the controller's name.\n\nFor instance, in the code snippet below, the MyController is the registered\ncontroller, and its functionality is available within the div element it's\nassociated with:\n\n<div ng-controller=\"MyController\">\n    <p>{{ myProperty }}</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE AND CODE IMPLEMENTATION\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n// Define a controller named 'MyController'\napp.controller('MyController', function($scope) {\n    // Initialize a property on the $scope object\n    $scope.myProperty = 'Hello, world!';\n});\n\n\nIn this example, app is the reference to the AngularJS module. By invoking the\ncontroller method on app and providing a name here,‘′MyController′‘here,\n`'MyController'`here,‘′MyController′‘ and a controller function, a new\ncontroller is created. The controller function typically takes $scope as an\nargument, through which it configures the scope object for the given view.\n\nLastly, the ng-controller directive is used. When the AngularJS framework\nencounters this directive, it connects the div element and its children with the\ncontroller, enabling $scope-based properties and methods within that \"scope\".","index":5,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"7.\n\n\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT A SERVICE IS IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"Services in AngularJS are singletons and facilitate sharing of functions,\nobjects, or values among different parts of an application.

It provides support for traditional RESTful APIs as well as AJAX\n   requests.\n\n * $injector: Serves as the dependency injection module, managing dependencies\n   across different components of the application.\n\n * $interval: Offers recurring task scheduling based on a specific time\n   interval.\n\n * $location: Encapsulates and abstracts the URL of the browser.\n\n * $log: A centralized logging tool for error and debugging messages.\n\n * $parse: Responsible for parsing AngularJS expressions and converting them\n   into functions.\n\n * $q: Provides mechanisms for asynchronous task management, such as promises\n   and deferred objects.\n\n * $rootElement: Represents the root element of the entire AngularJS\n   application.\n\n * $rootScope: Acts as the parent scope of all other scopes within the\n   application. Modifications to $rootScope are often discouraged.\n\n * $templateCache: Stores AngularJS templates, enabling their retrieval without\n   a server request.\n\n * $timeout: Offers a way to schedule specific tasks to execute after a certain\n   time delay.\n\n * $window: Acts as a wrapper, encapsulating the global window object.\n\n\nCUSTOM SERVICE TYPES\n\nDevelopers can create their own custom AngularJS services using any of three\nprimary methods: factory, service, and provider.\n\n 1. Factory: Delivers objects or primitives. A factory function returns whatever\n    type of object you want to provide. This gives you more freedom and can be\n    particularly useful when there are dependencies that need to be injected\n    into the factory function.\n\n 2. Service: Utilizes constructor functions. The service method takes a\n    constructor function, or the name of a constructor function. When AngularJS\n    injects your service into another component, it calls your constructor\n    function with the \"new\" keyword to create an instance of the service.\n\n 3. Provider: The provider method is the most flexible and powerful of the\n    three. It allows you to configure your service before your application\n    starts by defining a provider recipe.","index":6,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"8.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SHARE DATA BETWEEN CONTROLLERS IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"While AngularJS promotes a modular architecture where components are typically\nself-contained, you may need to share data between controllers. To facilitate\nthis, AngularJS offers a few primary methods.\n\n\nMETHODS FOR SHARING DATA BETWEEN CONTROLLERS IN ANGULARJS\n\n1. PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP\n\nIdentify that a hierarchal relationship already exists with one controller as\nthe parent of the other. Here it is not mandatory to use the vm.\n\nWhen to Use: Parent-child relationships are useful when one view must contain\nthe other and when you are building composite widgets.\n\n// Parent Controller\nangular.module('myApp').controller('ParentCtrl', function($scope) {\n  $scope.sharedData = 'Hello from parent';\n});\n\n// Child Controller\nangular.module('myApp').controller('ChildCtrl', function($scope) {\n  // Access the shared data from the parent\n  $scope.childSharedData = $scope.sharedData;\n});\n\n\n2. USING SERVICES\n\nCreate a service that acts as a data mediator between controllers. Use the this\ncontext to make the service's data accessible.\n\nWhen to Use: Services are an ideal choice when multiple controllers across the\napplication need access to the same data.\n\n// Shared Data Service\nangular.module('myApp').service('sharedDataService', function() {\n  this.sharedData = 'Hello from shared service';\n});\n\n// Controller 1\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl1', function(sharedDataService) {\n  this.dataFromService = sharedDataService.sharedData;\n});\n\n// Controller 2\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl2', function(sharedDataService) {\n  this.dataFromService = sharedDataService.sharedData;\n});\n\n\n3. USING ANGULARJS EVENTS\n\nUtilize $emit and $broadcast to trigger and capture events throughout the\napplication. $rootScope is essential for broadcasting.\n\n * $emit: Triggers events upwards through the $scope hierarchy.\n * $broadcast: Triggers events downwards through the $scope hierarchy.\n\nWhen to Use: Events are useful when one controller needs to notify other\ncontrollers in the application about an update or a change in the data.\n\n// Controller 1\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl1', function($rootScope) {\n  this.sendMessage = function(data) {\n    $rootScope.$emit('customEvent', data);\n  };\n});\n\n// Controller 2\nangular.module('myApp').controller('Ctrl2', function($rootScope) {\n  var unregister = $rootScope.$on('customEvent', function(event, data) {\n    console.log(data); // Process the received data\n    unregister(); // Unsubscribe from the custom event\n  });\n});\n","index":7,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"9.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE NG-APP DIRECTIVE?","answer":"The ng-app directive in AngularJS acts as the application's starting point. It\ndesignates the root element of an Angular application and initializes the\nrelevant application module.\n\n\nCORE FUNCTIONALITY\n\n * Bootstrapping: The directive is primarily responsible for kickstarting the\n   Angular application.\n * Module Specification: By specifying the ng-app directive, you connect it\n   explicitly to an Angular module. Without this connection, the HTML for\n   individual modules could become difficult to manage in larger applications.\n\n\nANGULAR BOOTSTRAPPING PROCESS\n\n 1. Load Angular: At the outset, the browser loads the Angular framework.\n\n 2. Identify Root Element: Upon document loading, Angular locates the HTML\n    element hosting the ng-app directive. This step is central to the\n    bootstrapping process, signaling the commencement of Angular operations.\n\n 3. Bootstrapping and Initialization: Angular boots up the application, linking\n    the identified root element to a specific module. The framework thematically\n    organizes application components into modules.\n\n 4. Compilation and Binding: Angular carries out two major operations: Template\n    Compilation - translating HTML into a set of instructions for the browser,\n    and Data Binding - setting up the data binding context. This process\n    associates the view with the logic managed inside the application modules.\n\n 5. Rendering and Interaction: The framework renders the prepared, efficient\n    template and establishes interactivity.\n\n\nNG-APP\n\nThe ng-app directive points out the root element of an AngularJS application.\nOnce the directive is used on any element, AngularJS assumes control of that\npart.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\" ng-app=\"myApp\">\n<head>\n    <!-- Head content -->\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div ng-controller=\"myCtrl\">\n        {{ greeting }} World! <!-- The controller provides the value of 'greeting' -->\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js\"></script>\n\n    <!-- The app module and main controller are defined and connected here -->\n    <script>\n        angular.module('myApp', []).controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {\n            $scope.greeting = 'Hello';\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n","index":8,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"10.\n\n\nEXPLAIN HOW NG-MODEL DIRECTIVE WORKS IN ANGULARJS.","answer":"AngularJS's two-way data binding feature is powered by directives like ng-model.\nThis mechanism synchronizes the Model and View layers, ensuring real-time\nupdates.\n\n\nCORE FUNCTIONS\n\n * Registers User Input: ng-model binds form elements to model data, using their\n   value/input as a source.\n * Keeps Model Updated: When the form element changes, the associated model\n   updates automatically.

It plays a pivotal role in defining and initializing the data and\nbusiness logic of a section of your application.\n\n\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n 1. Data Modeling: The controller depicts defined data models using Scope\n    objects. AngularJS uses two-way data binding, automatically keeping the\n    model and view in sync.\n\n 2. Business Logic: The controller implements business logic, often in the form\n    of functions, that governs the behavior of the model and its interaction\n    with the view.\n\n 3. Event Handling: Controllers can respond to user-initiated events like clicks\n    or form submissions. They also emit and handle custom events within the\n    application for inter-component communication.\n\n 4. Isolation: AngularJS controllers offer varying degrees of scope isolation,\n    ensuring modularity and preventing data or action overlaps in nested or\n    sibling components.\n\n 5. Initialization: Controllers set up an initial state, execute start-up tasks,\n    and prepare the contextual environment for the rest of the application.\n\n\nCONTROLLER DEFINITION\n\nA controller in AngularJS is defined using the app.controller() method, where\napp is your module:\n\nCONTROLLER DEFINITION CODE\n\n * JavaScript:\n   \n   // Define the module\n   var app = angular.module('myApp', []);\n   \n   // Create the controller\n   app.controller('MyController', function($scope) {\n     $scope.greeting = 'Hello, World!';\n   });\n   \n   \n   The controller is attached to a module using the app.controller() method,\n   which takes the controller name and a function, called the controller's\n   constructor.\n\n * HTML:\n   \n   <div ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"MyController\">\n     {{ greeting }}\n   </div>\n   \n   \n   In this example, ng-controller=\"MyController\" attaches the defined controller\n   to the section of HTML enclosed within the element.\n\n\nDATA BINDING\n\nAngularJS uses two-way data binding. Any changes in the model, like variables\ndefined in the $scope object, automatically reflect in the view, and vice versa.\n\nTWO-WAY BINDING CODE\n\n * JavaScript:\n   \n   app.controller('MyController', function($scope) {\n     $scope.greeting = 'Hello, World!';\n     $scope.updateGreeting = function(newGreeting) {\n       $scope.greeting = newGreeting;\n     };\n   });\n   \n\n * HTML:\n   \n   <div ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"MyController\">\n     <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"greeting\">\n     <button ng-click=\"updateGreeting('Goodbye!')\">Update Greeting</button>\n   </div>\n   \n   \n   As seen in both the HTML and JavaScript snippets, any changes in the text\n   input or via the button immediately update the greeting displayed.\n\n\nSCOPE & DEPENDENCY INJECTION\n\nAngularJS controllers are constructed using the Dependency Injection design\npattern. The $scope object is the nexus for data-binding and a medium through\nwhich the controller interacts with the view.\n\nThe definition of the controller function receives dependencies like $scope, and\nAngularJS maintains a registry of these dependencies, resolving them whenever\nthe controller is initialized.","index":13,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"15.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU DEFINE A CONTROLLER'S METHOD IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"AngularJS uses the MVC architectural pattern.

Each matched directive is then registered and paired\nwith a corresponding template function.\n\nThe template function furnishes the directive with a specialized template and\ncan offer jQuery or jqLite wrapped element manipulation methods, such as\naddClass and find.\n\napp.directive('myDirective', function() {\n  return {\n    compile: function(element, attributes) {\n      element.text('This is my directive!');\n    }\n  };\n});\n\n\n\nLINK PHASE\n\nThe link phase is closely interwoven with the compile phase and follows after\nit. It provides a location for setting up data binding between the model and the\nview.\n\nOnce the compile phase is complete, AngularJS links the directives with the\nappropriate scope and prepares them for integration with the parent controller.\n\nThe link phase can occur more than once with scope adapters in the case of\ntranscluded directives or with isolated ones instructed to use shared\nattributes.\n\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLE: CHILD DIRECTIVE WITHIN A TEMPLATE (NGIF)\n\nConsider the example below:\n\nHTML\n\n<div ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"ParentController as parent\">\n  <button ng-click=\"parent.toggleChild()\">Toggle Child</button>\n  <div ng-if=\"parent.childVisible\">\n    <child></child>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nJAVASCRIPT\n\nvar app = angular.module('myApp', []);\napp.controller('ParentController', function() {\n  this.childVisible = true;\n  this.toggleChild = function() {\n    this.childVisible = !this.childVisible;\n  };\n});\napp.directive('child', function() {\n  return {\n    template: '<div>I am the child directive!</div>',\n    link: function(scope, element) {\n      element.addClass('highlight');\n    }\n  };\n});\n\n\nIn this case:\n\n * Compile Phase: Discover the ng-if directive, then the matching element\n   wrapped by the ng-if transclusion function.\n * Link Phase: Apply a $scope adapter, link the child directive with the shared\n   scope, and add a class for highlighting.\n\n\nCHANGE DETECTION CONTEXT\n\nWith shared/attribute adaptors, two types of change detection contexts emerge:\n\n * Shared Context: The directive employs the exact scope as its parent\n   controller. This mode is more efficient as it doesn't need to create any new\n   scopes.\n * New Isolated Scope: This creates a fresh scope for the directive to operate\n   on, independent of its parental scopes. It's especially advantageous when you\n   want to insulate the directive from the external environment, helping to\n   avoid unintended side-effects.\n\nEach directive type, however, only keeps track of the context it defines or\noperates in. In the above example, the child directive has no cognizance of the\n$scope.toggleChild method or the fact that its visibility is predicated on an\nexpression. That's why an element manipulation was employed instead to portray a\nvisual cue in response to the parent controller's internal state.\n\n\nSCOPE $DIGEST CYCLE: THE BACKBONE OF DATA BINDING\n\nAt the heart of AngularJS' change detection mechanism is the $digest cycle,\nwhich inspects every registered scope for any changes to their associated data\nmodel or view. It continues to iterate until no further changes are detected or\na maximum of 10 iterations is achieved, preserving performance.\n\nAngularJS employs the \"dirty checking\" strategy. Whenever a directive, model, or\nview alters, it marks the encompassing scope and all its progenitors as \"dirty\".\nDuring the $digest loop, all registered scopes are checked, and if any are found\nto be dirty, they undergo reassessment of their associated variables or\nexpressions.\n\nA successful and efficient $digest cycle will quell further evaluations when no\nnew changes are identified. This helps to avoid needless, iterative evaluations\nand ensure fluid application behavior.","index":17,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"19.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN '@', '=', AND '&' IN DIRECTIVE SCOPES?","answer":"Let's discuss the meaning of directives on the most common types of scope\nbindings: Simple text interpolation, Two-way binding and Expression evaluation.\n\nIn AngularJS, both directives and components can have isolated scopes, bound\nscopes, or inherit from their parent scope.

While this is convenient for standard elements, you might\nneed a custom directive to support two-way data binding with non-standard ones,\nlike sliders or color pickers.\n\nFor this purpose, AngularJS provides a mechanism called parser and formatter to\nformat values going in and out of the model.\n\nLet's look at a code example to elaborate further.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: TWO-WAY DATA BINDING IN A RANGE SLIDER\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\nangular.module('myApp', [])\n  .controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {\n    $scope.sliderValue = 50;\n  })\n  .directive('rangeSlider', function() {\n    return {\n      restrict: 'E',\n      scope: {\n        value: '=ngModel'\n      },\n      template: '<input type=\"range\" style=\"width:200px\" />',\n      require: 'ngModel',\n      link: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModelCtrl) {\n        var rangeInput = element.find('input');\n        \n        rangeInput.on('input', function() {\n          scope.$apply(function() {\n            ngModelCtrl.$setViewValue(rangeInput.val());\n          });\n        });\n        \n        ngModelCtrl.$render = function() {\n          rangeInput.val(ngModelCtrl.$viewValue);\n        };\n\n        ngModelCtrl.$formatters.push(function(value) {\n          return parseInt(value, 10);\n        });\n\n        ngModelCtrl.$parsers.push(function(value) {\n          return parseInt(value, 10);\n        });\n      }\n    };\n  });\n\n\nIn this example, the custom rangeSlider directive sets up a two-way data binding\nwith ngModel to connect the range input to the $scope.\n\n\nKEY POINTS:\n\n * The ngModel attribute is used for two-way data binding. The value: '=ngModel'\n   in the directive's scope defines the binding.\n * The link function establishes the behavior of the directive. It sets up both\n   $parsers and $formatters.\n * ngModelCtrl: This provides an interface for the directive to interact with\n   the ngModel controllers.\n\n\nCODE WALKTHROUGH\n\n * Setup: The directive consumes model data using the ngModel attribute and\n   defines its own behavior for syncing the data. The ngModelCtrl offers methods\n   like $setViewValue and $viewValue for communication.\n * Event Listening: The directive listens to changes on the input element within\n   the directive's template and uses $apply to reflect these changes in the\n   model.\n * Data Transformation: The $parsers and $formatters pipelines ensure that data\n   is translated both ways. For example, a slider's value is numeric, but the\n   model might expect a string representation.\n\n\nOPTIMIZING VIEW UPDATES WITH $ASYNCVALIDATORS\n\nTo optimize view updates and model changes, you can use $asyncValidators to\nvalidate the range input asynchronously. If the input is invalid, the model and\nthe view will not be updated. This is useful for elements like a slider where\nit's important to ensure the input is within a certain range.\n\nHere is how you could optimize the code:\n\nngModelCtrl.$asyncValidators.rangeValidator = function(modelValue, viewValue) {\n  var value = modelValue || viewValue;\n  if (value >= 0 && value <= 100) {\n    return $q.resolve();\n  } else {\n    return $q.reject();\n  }\n};\n","index":19,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"21.\n\n\nDIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SERVICES AND FACTORIES IN ANGULARJS.","answer":"Let's look at the fundamental distinctions between AngularJS's factories and\nservices.\n\n\nUNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nSERVICE\n\nAn AngularJS service is a singleton object injected via function parameters.\nWhen it's first injected, it's instantiated with the new keyword.

It acts as the\nroot module for the entire application or as a feature-specific module which can\nbe loaded on demand.\n\n\nBASIC MODULE STRUCTURE\n\nA module is defined using the angular.module constructor. It requires a unique\nmodule identifier and can additionally specify module dependencies. It follows\nthe syntax:\n\nangular.module('myModuleName', ['dependencyModule1', 'dependencyModule2']);\n\n\n\nMODULE INITIALIZATION\n\n * On-Demand: By depending on other modules, your module can initialize whenever\n   all its dependencies are available during a hierarchical load, where modules\n   are loaded in a strict order.\n * Top-Level: If it doesn’t rely on parent modules, you can define it as a\n   top-level module.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CREATING A MODULE\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n// Define the main app module\nvar myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);\n\n// Define a controller within the app module\nmyApp.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {\n    $scope.greeting = 'Hello, World!';\n});\n\n\nIn this example, we initialized an app module with the identifier myApp and an\nempty dependency array. We also added a controller myCtrl to the same module.\n\n\nCONFIGURATION AND RUN BLOCKS\n\nBoth .config() and .run() methods are used to define tasks that need to be\nexecuted during the application setup.\n\n * The .config() method is where you set up configurations and provide service\n   providers.\n\n * The .run() method is used to execute code after all modules are loaded,\n   making it suitable for additional setup, such as initializing global\n   variables or registering event listeners.\n   \n   * It is common to use run blocks for tasks like authenticating a user or\n     initializing some global state.\n\n\nADVANCED MODULE FEATURES\n\nMODULE DEPENDENCIES\n\nModules can depend on other modules, which are loaded and attached to the\ndependent modules.\n\nCOMPONENT REGISTRATION\n\nModules can also contain various types of components like controllers, services,\nfilters, directives, factories, and providers that correspond to the individual\nbuilding blocks of the MVC design pattern in AngularJS.\n\n\nCORE MODULES\n\nAngularJS comes with core modules that extend its functionality. Popular core\nmodules include:\n\n * ng: This is the core module, providing basic directives such as ng-app and\n   ng-model.\n * ngRoute: helps with single-page application routing.\n * ngResource: useful for RESTful API communication.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES AND LIMITATIONS\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Module Organization: Keep modules organized by feature or by functionality.\n   This makes the code more maintainable and testable.\n\n * Lazy-Loading Dependencies: Load only the modules you need, when you need\n   them. This reduces the initial application load time.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\n * Runtime Restrictions in Minification: When you minify your code in\n   production, some dependency-injection-related issues might arise if you're\n   not using declarations like $inject.\n\n * Order of Dependency Declaration: Dependencies must be declared in the right\n   order, especially if your code isn’t minified.","index":25,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"27.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE NGROUTE MODULE IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"The ngRoute module in AngularJS provides client-side routing within your\napplication, allowing you to configure different view templates and controllers\nfor specific URLs.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * $routeProvider: Configures routes using a declarative approach.

When it\nidentifies an unsatisfied parameter in a constructor, it looks up the relevant\nservice and provides it.\n\n\nMETHOD INJECTION\n\nAngular's method injection is designed to work with controller classes. If a\ncontroller method expects certain services or dependencies, Angular\nautomatically injects them based on the method's parameter list.\n\n\nDIRECTIVES AND PROVIDERS\n\nDirectives are often associated with server types, but Angular provides a high\nlevel of versatility in this regard.\n\n * directives: Ideal for stateless, UI-related services. The controller and link\n   functions enable dependency injection.\n * providers: Offers the most extensive DI capabilities, often used for\n   third-party integrations and advanced services. Instances are configurable.\n\n\nUNIFIED MECHANISM: $INJECT\n\nWhile constructor and method injection streamline the process, controllers and\nservices will lose injection information after minification. To resolve this,\nyou can establish an $inject property in their classes.\n\nmyModule.controller(\"myController\", MyControllerClass);\nMyControllerClass.$inject = [\"dependency1\", \"dependency2\"];\n\n\n\nSHARP CONTRAST TO ANGULAR 2+\n\nAngularJS's DI model differs significantly from both Angular versions 2 and\nlater, and it's less modular and flexible.

Minification, however, can strip or mangle these\nnames, leading to errors.\n\nFor example, if you have a controller in your app that looks like this:\n\napp.controller('myController', function($scope, dataService) {\n  // ... controller logic\n});\n\n\nA minifier might shorten the parameter names:\n\napp.controller('myController',function(a,b){ });\n\n\nThis change will cause a problem because AngularJS will no longer know what to\ninject, making your app crash.\n\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\nARRAY NOTATION\n\nUsing an array format can avoid dependency name mangling. Provide the service\nnames as strings in a specific order. Several Angular methods support this tool.\n\nHere's the previous controller example modified to use array notation:\n\napp.controller('myController', ['$scope', 'dataService', function(a, b) {\n  // ... controller logic\n}]);\n\n\nThe parameter names are now minification-proof since they correspond to service\nnames instead of generic variable names.\n\nNGSTRICTDI MODE\n\nWhen enabled, AngularJS enters strict dependency injection mode. This setting\nensures that the array annotation pattern is used consistently.\n\nActivate this mode in the application's module configuration to require array\nnotation for all dependency declarations.\n\nangular.module('myApp', []).config(['$compileProvider', function ($compileProvider){\n  $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);\n}]);\n\n\nINLINE ARRAY ANNOTATION\n\nAngular allows in-line array notation for module creation and controller and\nservice registration.\n\nUsing this method, you can define your module and its dependencies like so:\n\nvar myModule = angular.module('myModule', ['$dependency1', '$dependency2', function(d1, d2){\n  // Module logic\n}]);\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nWhile these workarounds offer some protection against minification issues, keep\nin mind that newer versions of Angular like 2+, and 3 use TypeScript primarily\nand do not depend on these workarounds. If you are considering starting a new\nproject, it's better to use one of these versions.","index":28,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"30.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE USE OF $ROUTEPROVIDER IN ANGULARJS.","answer":"The $routeProvider in AngularJS sets up the routes for navigating within a\nsingle-page application (SPA), allowing user movement without requiring full\nreloads.\n\n\nCORE COMPONENTS\n\n * when(): Configures the route, defining what template and controller should be\n   employed.

It's analogous to\nArray#map but for views, not data.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Binding: Elements within the ng-repeat directive are bound to the\n   corresponding collection items, making it easy to reflect changes.\n\n * Change Tracking: It monitors the collection and keeps the view in sync, so if\n   there are any additions, removals, or updates in the list, the view is\n   automatically updated to reflect these changes.\n\n * $index: ng-repeat gives you the current iteration index, starting from 0.\n\n * Deep Copy Behavior: If nested collections are present within the collection\n   being repeated through, it makes and maintains a deep copy of the collection.\n   \n   This means that any mutations in the original collection don't affect the\n   view, and vice versa. It makes use of angular.copy to achieve that. However,\n   this does not apply between the model and the scope.\n\n * track by: ng-repeat can improve performance by identifying elements through\n   keys rather than indices.

This means it directly associates each rendered DOM element with\nthe array's corresponding index.\n\nEXAMPLE: TRACK BY INDEX\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\nangular.module('myApp', [])\n  .controller('MyController', function() {\n    var vm = this;\n    vm.items = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'];\n\n    vm.removeItem = function(index) {\n      vm.items.splice(index, 1);\n    };\n  });\n\n\nAnd the HTML:\n\n<div ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"MyController as ctrl\">\n  <ul>\n    <li ng-repeat=\"item in ctrl.items\" ng-click=\"ctrl.removeItem($index)\">{{ item }}</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nUsing $index as the tracking mechanism means that any changes to the array like\naddition, removal, or reordering of elements might invalidate the previously\nrendered DOM nodes.\n\nThis can lead to inefficient updates as the entire list might need to be\nre-rendered in certain scenarios, rather than updating just the specific item\nthat has been altered.\n\nTherefore, in lieu of this method, AngularJS typically recommends using unique\nidentifiers for objects when they are present as array elements (like MongoDB\nObjectId or a UUID). For basic arrays, often, the default behavior of ng-repeat\nwithout tracking by index or unique identifiers is sufficient.\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * The $index provided by ng-repeat indicates the ordinal position of an item\n   within the repeated collection.\n * Using $index as the tracking mechanism does not ensure efficiency in DOM\n   updates, and might not be the best approach in most scenarios.\n * For precise tracking of array elements, unique identifiers are more efficient\n   and typically the preferred method.

or directives in which a controller is in use, can use\n   $scope.$on to get informed when a child scope fires an event using\n   $broadcast.\n\n\n$EMIT AND $ON\n\n * On the other hand, child controllers can use $scope.$on to listen to events\n   from their parent scopes if those parent scopes are sending events using\n   $emit.\n\nINTERACTIVE EXAMPLE: EVENT PROPAGATION\n\nLet's consider an example.\n\n * We have a parent controller and two child controllers.\n * Each controller has a button that triggers an event.\n\nEvent Propagation Example [https://i.imgur.com/3yvwwxO.png]\n\nHere are the code snippets for the controllers and the HTML structure:\n\n<div ng-controller=\"ParentController\">\n  <button ng-click=\"parentButtonClick()\">Trigger Parent Event</button>\n  <div ng-controller=\"FirstChildController\">\n    <button ng-click=\"firstChildButtonClick()\">Trigger First Child Event</button>\n    <div ng-controller=\"SecondChildController\">\n      <button ng-click=\"secondChildButtonClick()\">Trigger Second Child Event</button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\napp.controller('ParentController', function($scope) {\n  $scope.parentButtonClick = function() {\n    $scope.$emit('parentEvent');\n  };\n});\n\napp.controller('FirstChildController', function($scope) {\n  $scope.firstChildButtonClick = function() {\n    $scope.$broadcast('firstChildEvent');\n  };\n});\n\napp.controller('SecondChildController', function($scope) {\n  $scope.secondChildButtonClick = function() {\n    $scope.$broadcast('secondChildEvent');\n  };\n\n  $scope.$on('parentEvent', function() {\n    console.log('Received parentEvent in SecondChildController');\n  });\n\n  $scope.$on('firstChildEvent', function() {\n    console.log('Received firstChildEvent in SecondChildController');\n  });\n\n  $scope.$on('secondChildEvent', function() {\n    console.log('Received secondChildEvent in SecondChildController');\n  });\n});\n\n\nIn this setup, we can observe the Event Propagation behavior as described\nearlier.","index":39,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack

$HTTP.","answer":"When using $http to make asynchronous calls in AngularJS, you are not working\nwith raw HTTP requests. Instead, what you get is a promise.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF USING PROMISES\n\n * Readable Asynchronous Code: Promises represent asynchronous tasks, making\n   code easier to read and maintain.\n\n * Error Handling: Along with success, they facilitate efficient error handling,\n   allowing you to separate happy and distress paths in your code.\n\n * Chainability and Data Transformation: They provide a more concise way to\n   chain asynchronous tasks, making code execution and data manipulation a\n   streamlined process.\n\n * Eager Execution of Function: The function you pass to then or catch is\n   executed as soon as the corresponding operation is completed (either success\n   or error).\n\n * Better Performance: Using chaining instead of nested callbacks can lead to\n   better performance and memory utilisation.\n\n * Built-In Delay Mechanisms: You can introduce time delays, or specify a\n   particular order of execution among a set of promises.\n\n * Avoidance of Callback Hell: While traditional asynchronous handling may lead\n   to nested callbacks (commonly referred to as callback hell), promises help\n   keep code organized and readable.\n\n\nPROMISE STATES\n\nPromises can exist in one of the following states:\n\n * Pending: The asynchronous operation hasn't completed or failed yet.\n * Fulfilled: The operation succeeded, and the promise now holds the resulting\n   data.\n * Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise holds the associated error.\n\nA promise can transition from a pending state to either a fulfilled or rejected\nstate but once it does, it cannot change again.\n\n\nWORKING WITH $HTTP PROMISES\n\nThe $http service provides an asynchronous mechanism for making HTTP requests\nand returns a promise. The promise it returns is specific to HTTP requests and\nprovides the following essential methods:\n\n * then: Registers callbacks to be executed when the promise is resolved or\n   rejected. The first function is called when the promise is fulfilled, the\n   second when the promise is rejected.\n\n * catch: A shorthand for calling then(null, rejection), useful for catching\n   errors.\n\n * finally: Allows you to execute specific logic tasks whether the promise was\n   resolved or rejected. It is commonly used for actions such as cleanup that\n   should occur regardless of the promise's outcome.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING $HTTP PROMISES\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\n$http.get('https://api.example.com/data')\n    .then(function(response) {\n        // Handle the successful response here\n        console.log(response.data);\n    })\n    .catch(function(error) {\n        // Handle any errors that might have occurred during the request\n        console.error('Error', error);\n    })\n    .finally(function() {\n        // This code will be executed whether the request was successful or not\n        console.log('Request completed, regardless of success or failure');\n    });\n","index":41,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"43.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE AN AJAX CALL USING ANGULARJS?","answer":"In AngularJS, AJAX requests are handled using the $http service. This service\nabstracts calls to the server, often utilizing the RESTful principle.\n\nThe $http service uses a promise-based interface (then and catch) for handling\nresponses. When making a request, you need to provide the method, URL, and\noptionally data or configuration.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: $HTTP SERVICE\n\nHere is a basic example of using $http:\n\nangular.module('httpExample', [])\n  .controller('FetchController', ['$scope', '$http',\n    function($scope, $http) {\n      var vm = this;\n      vm.method = 'GET';\n      vm.url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1';\n      vm.makeRequest = function() {\n          $http({\n              method: vm.method,\n              url: vm.url\n            }).then(function successCallback(response) {\n                // Handle success\n              }, function errorCallback(response) {\n                // Handle error\n              });\n      };\n    }\n  ]);\n  \n/*\n    In HTML:\n    <div ng-app=\"httpExample\">\n        <div ng-controller=\"FetchController as vm\">\n            <select ng-model=\"vm.method\">\n                <option value=\"GET\">GET</option>\n                <option value=\"POST\">POST</option>\n            </select>\n            <input ng-model=\"vm.url\" type=\"text\">\n            <button ng-click=\"vm.makeRequest()\">Make request</button>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n*/\n\n\nIn this example, the user can select the HTTP method and input the URL to make a\nrequest when clicking the associated button.\n\n\nCHAINING PROMISES\n\nThe $http service returns a promise which allows methods to be chained\nconveniently.\n\nHere's a case using then, where the first promise transforms response data\nbefore passing it to the second promise:\n\n$http.get('someUrl')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    return response.data;\n  })\n  .then(function(data) {\n    // Do something with the transformed data\n  });\n\n\n\nPARALLEL REQUESTS\n\nAngular makes it easy to combine several $http promises and execute a function\nonce all of them have resolved using $q.all().\n\nvar req1 = $http.get('/url1');\nvar req2 = $http.get('/url2');\n\n$q.all([req1, req2]).then(function(results) {\n    var firstResult = results[0].data;\n    var secondResult = results[1].data;\n    // Do something with both results\n});\n\n\n\nCANCELLING REQUESTS\n\nAngular doesn't have a built-in request cancellation mechanism, but you can\nmanually abort requests. For example, by using a timeout promise.\n\n\nINTERCEPTORS\n\nYou can use interceptor functions for request and response transformations. They\nare registered using $httpProvider. A common use case is for request\nauthentication.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REQUEST TRANSFORM\n\nIn this code, the authToken is an object with a token property. The request\ninterceptor adds the token to the request headers.\n\nangular.module('authInterceptor', [])\n  .factory('authService', function($q) {\n    return {\n      authToken: { token: 'abc123' },\n      request: function(config) {\n        config.headers['x-auth-token'] = authService.authToken.token;\n        return config;\n      }\n    }\n  })\n  .config(function($httpProvider) {\n    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('authService');\n  });\n","index":42,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"44.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN $HTTP AND $RESOURCE?","answer":"AngularJS introduces two main approaches for making server-side requests and\nintegrating RESTful services: $http and $resource.\n\n\n$HTTP\n\n$http is an AngularJS service that provides a general mechanism for sending HTTP\nrequests over the network. It's a more low-level API, fitting for\ncustomizations.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Methods: Supports the standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,\n   etc.\n * Validity Check: Being less opinionated, it won't carry out any payload\n   validations unless explicitly programmed.\n * Interceptors: Activates global interceptors for all HTTP requests.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: $HTTP\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n$http({\n    method: 'GET',\n    url: 'https://api.example.com/data'\n}).then(function(response) {\n    // Handle the response\n}, function(error) {\n    // Handle the error\n});\n\n\n\n$RESOURCE\n\n$resource is a higher-level abstraction built on top of $http. It's specifically\ntailored to interact with RESTful backend services and provides built-in\nmechanisms for common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n * Methods: Auto-generates methods for standard CRUD actions like query(),\n   save(), remove(). This can save development time and reduce error.\n\n * Payload Validation: Conducts standard input/output format validations for\n   resources.\n\n * Interceptors: Allows resource-specific interceptors. This could be useful for\n   scenarios where you need different authentication or caching mechanisms for\n   different resources.\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: $RESOURCE\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\nvar UserResource = $resource('https://api.example.com/user/:id', { id: '@id' });\n\nUserResource.query(function(users) {\n    // Handle the list of users\n});\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nChoose $http when you require more control over the HTTP requests or are working\nwith non-standard APIs. Use $resource for projects tightly integrated with\nRESTful services to take advantage of its higher-level abstractions and built-in\nfeatures, reducing boilerplate code.","index":43,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"45.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU INTERCEPT REQUESTS IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"You can use the config method in AngularJS to redirect or alter specific request\nparameters. This approach is especially useful for:\n\n * Authentication\n * Translating endpoints\n * Redirecting to other URLs\n\nHere is the code:\n\nangular.module('myApp', [])\n  .config(['$httpProvider', function($httpProvider) {\n    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('MyInterceptor');\n  }])\n\n  .factory('MyInterceptor', function() {\n    return {\n      'request': function(config) {\n        // Modify or inspect the request config\n        return config;\n      }\n    };\n  });\n\n\nInterceptor functions are called whenever a request is about to retrieve or send\ndata to/from the server. These functions have access to the config object before\nthe request is made.\n\nThis allows you to perform tasks such as:\n\n * Attaching authorization headers\n * Adding authentication tokens\n * Redirecting requests to a different server\n * Custom logging and debugging'action.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE\n\nHere is the code:\n\n// Configure interceptor\nangular.module('myApp', [])\n  .config(['$httpProvider', function($httpProvider) {\n    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('MyInterceptor');\n  }])\n\n  // Define interceptor factory\n  .factory('MyInterceptor', function() {\n    return {\n      'request': function(config) {\n        // Add authentication header\n        config.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer myToken123';\n        return config;\n      },\n      'responseError': function(response) {\n        // Handle server errors\n        if (response.status === 401) {\n          // Custom logic for unauthorized access\n          // Redirect to login page or show an error message\n        }\n        return response;\n      }\n    };\n  });\n\n\nIn this example, the MyInterceptor factory is created, and the 'request' method\nis used to modify the request configuration. Here, we are adding an\nauthentication token to the request header for secure API access.\n\n'responseError' is another method, mainly for error-handling purposes. If the\nserver returns a 401 (Unauthorized) status, we can define custom logic, such as\nredirecting to a login page.\n\n\nSECURITY CONSIDERATION\n\nWhile interceptors can be a powerful tool for managing requests in your\napplication, it's crucial to handle sensitive data and security-related tasks,\nsuch as authentication, securely.

The ngRoute module provides this functionality.\n\n\nSTEPS TO ENABLE ROUTING\n\n 1. Import Angular Route Module: Include the angular-route.js file in your\n    project and inject 'ngRoute' as a dependency.\n    \n    Example: index.html\n    \n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.8/angular-route.js\"></script>\n    \n\n 2. Inject Dependency: Add 'ngRoute' to your application's dependencies.\n    \n    Example: app.js\n    \n    angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']);\n    \n\n 3. Configure Routes: Use the $routeProvider service in your app's configuration\n    phase to define routes.\n    \n    Example: app.js\n    \n    angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute'])\n      .config(function($routeProvider) {\n        $routeProvider\n          .when('/home', {\n              templateUrl: 'views/home.html',\n              controller: 'HomeController'\n          })\n          .when('/about', {\n              templateUrl: 'views/about.html',\n              controller: 'AboutController'\n          })\n          .otherwise({ redirectTo: '/home' });\n      });\n    \n\n 4. Bind Routes: In your HTML, use the ng-view directive to specify the view\n    area where the routing results should be rendered.\n    \n    Example: index.html\n    \n    <body ng-app=\"myApp\">\n        <div ng-view></div>\n    </body>\n    \n\n\nADDITIONAL TIPS\n\n * View Composition: Use the ng-view directive to specify the target area where\n   the view determined by the route will be displayed. Also, use the templateUrl\n   attribute to load an external template, and the controller attribute to link\n   a controller with the view.\n\n * Default Route: If the current URL doesn't match any of the provided routes,\n   the framework will attempt to redirect to the route defined by otherwise() by\n   default. If it doesn't exist, nothing will be displayed.\n\n * Route-Dependent Controllers: Each route can be associated with a different\n   controller using the controller attribute.\n\n * Route Parameters: You can use the :param notation to define route parameters,\n   which can then be accessed in the controller.\n\n * History Management: AngularJS ngRoute module provides $location and\n   $routeParams services to handle the history and route parameters.\n\n * Directives: A few directives are specific to the routing mechanism, such as\n   ng-view, which defines the area in which a route should be displayed, and\n   ng-href and ng-attr-href, which allow dynamic changes to the route.","index":45,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"47.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE ROLES OF $ROUTEPROVIDER AND $LOCATION IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"In AngularJS, $routeProvider and $location are fundamental constructs for\nrouting and URL management.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * $routeProvider: This module configures routes and declares which view,\n   controller, and template to use for each route.\n * $location: This service synchronizes the application's state with the\n   browser's URL.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: $ROUTEPROVIDER\n\nHere is the JavaScript code:\n\nvar app = angular.module(\"myApp\", [\"ngRoute\"]);\napp.config(function($routeProvider) {\n    $routeProvider\n    .when(\"/home\", {\n        templateUrl: \"home.html\",\n        controller: \"homeCtrl\"\n    })\n    .when(\"/about\", {\n        templateUrl: \"about.html\",\n        controller: \"aboutCtrl\"\n    })\n    .otherwise({\n        redirectTo: '/home'\n    });\n});\n\n\nIn the HTML code:\n\n<a href=\"#/home\">Home</a>\n<a href=\"#/about\">About</a>\n<ng-view></ng-view>\n\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: $LOCATION\n\nIn the JavaScript code:\n\napp.controller(\"myCtrl\", function($scope, $location) {\n    $scope.navigate = function(path) {\n        $location.path(path);\n    };\n});\n\n\nIn the HTML code:\n\n<button ng-click=\"navigate('/home')\">Go to Home</button>\n<button ng-click=\"navigate('/about')\">Go to About</button>\n","index":46,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"48.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF MULTIPLE VIEWS AND ROUTING IN ANGULARJS.","answer":"Multiple views in AngularJS refer to the capability to divide a user interface\ninto distinct areas that can simultaneously display separate content. Angular's\nrouting functions allow each view area to be associated with a unique URL state,\nenabling a visually cohesive and functional user experience.\n\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n * Views: The visual segments or content areas of an application.\n * Router: A mechanism for mapping URLs to specific views.\n * Templates: HTML files that define the structure of a view.\n * Controllers: JavaScript functions that manage view logic and data.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\nANGULAR NGROUTE\n\nThe ngRoute module serves as Angular's official routing library.\n\n * Basic Setup: The ngRoute module must be registered as a dependency and\n   configured to establish the route definitions.\n\n * Route Configuration: It defines the template, controller, and other data\n   associated with a specific route URL.\n   \n   Example:\n   \n   app.config(function($routeProvider) {\n       $routeProvider\n           .when('/dashboard', {\n               templateUrl: 'dashboard.html',\n               controller: 'DashboardController'\n           })\n           .when('/user/:userId', {\n               templateUrl: 'userDetail.html',\n               controller: 'UserDetailController'\n           })\n           .otherwise({redirectTo: '/'});\n   });\n   \n\n * Views and ngView: ngView is a directive that acts as a placeholder within an\n   application's top-level HTML template. It's where each route's template\n   content is rendered.\n   \n   Example:\n   \n   Top-level HTML:\n   \n   <div ng-view></div>\n   \n\n * Links and ngHref\n   \n   Example:\n   \n   <a ng-href=\"#/user/{{user.id}}\">View Details</a>\n   \n\nANGULAR UI-ROUTER\n\nui-router is a popular alternative to ngRoute, providing additional features\nsuch as nested views and state management.\n\n * State-based Routing\n   \n   States are distinct, named representations of a specific view, defined\n   through the $stateProvider service. Each state describes what the URL should\n   look like and what view it should load. This allows for flexible navigation\n   between states and can be particularly useful for multi-level navigation or\n   features that do not neatly fit into a single page or view.\n   \n   Example:\n   \n   $stateProvider\n       .state('dashboard', {\n           url: '/dashboard',\n           templateUrl: 'dashboard.html'\n       })\n       .state('userDetail', {\n           url: '/user/:userId',\n           templateUrl: 'userDetail.html'\n       });\n   \n\n * Nested Views: This feature allows the nesting of views within other views,\n   making it possible to create more complex, hierarchical layouts.\n\n * View Hierarchies: Views are organized into a tree-like structure, reflective\n   of the application hierarchy defined by state routes.\n\n * Directives: ui-router provides enhanced directives like ui-sref for\n   navigating between states.\n   \n   Example:\n   \n   <a ui-sref=\"userDetail({userId: user.id})\">View Details</a>\n   \n\nOTHER ROUTING OPTIONS\n\nAngular also provides out-of-the-box hashbang mode for routing, where routes are\nshaped like myapp.com/#/dashboard.

The reason for this behavior is that href expects a constant string\nURL, and it doesn't set up any means to update the URL if the dynamicLink\nchanges.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n * For dynamic links or URLs under AngularJS control, such as those coming from\n   AJAX or user interactions, use ng-href.\n * For static, non-AngularJS controlled links, href suffices.\n * Best Practice: Be mindful of mixing dynamic and static behaviors, as doing so\n   might lead to unexpected results.\n\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * ng-href: Incorporating dynamic URLs, including those based on user input or\n   obtained from an external source, for consistent sync.\n * href: Ideal for static URLs or those updated solely through JavaScript.\n\nIn summary, ng-href ensures Angular data-binding for dynamic hyperlinks, whereas\nhref is better suited for static or non-Angular URLs.","index":48,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"50.\n\n\nHOW DOES FORM VALIDATION WORK IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"AngularJS facilitates form validation by tracking the input's state and updating\nits associated $valid and $invalid flags. It also configures the form controller\nand its APIs through directives, enabling interactive form behaviors.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS OF ANGULARJS FORM VALIDATION\n\n * Input Elements: Tagged with ng-model and validators such as required or\n   custom ones. Their state and validation are controlled by AngularJS.\n\n * Form Elements: Utilize the name attribute to become part of the form's\n   associative array. They also provide form-level validation and other\n   FormController-specific methods.\n\n * Form Controller: Gives access to the form’s state, such as $valid, $invalid,\n   $pristine, and $dirty, and includes methods to interact with its child\n   inputs.\n\n\nANGULARDIRECTIVES FOR FORM AND INPUT VALIDATION\n\nThe ngModel directive links form controls (such as input, select, or textarea)\nto a text field, taking it a step further by providing additional validation\nstate flags.\n\nNGMODEL DIRECTIVES\n\n * $pristine: Remains true if the user hasn't altered the input data.\n * $dirty: Transitions to true after the user modifies the input.\n * $valid: Stays true as long as the input conforms to all validation rules or\n   doesn't have any set.\n * $invalid: Switches to true if the input violates at least one validation\n   rule.\n\nINPUT-SPECIFIC VALIDATORS\n\nAngularJS ships with various validators designed for specific input types:\n\n * ng-aria: Offers accessibility tools.\n * ng-pattern: Validates input against a given regular expression.\n * ng-minlength/ng-maxlength: Checks the input length.\n\nCustom validators can be constructed using the ngModel controller, offering\ngreater flexibility and the ability to perform more precise validations.\n\n\nSAMPLE ANGULARJS FORM\n\nHere is the HTML:\n\n<form name=\"myForm\" novalidate>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\" ng-model=\"firstName\" ng-pattern=\"/^[A-Za-z]+$/\">\n  <span ng-show=\"myForm.firstName.$error.pattern\">Alphabets only!</span>\n  <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"lastName\" required>\n  <div>Form is {{myForm.$valid ?

If it changes often but doesn't\n   need to be displayed frequently, avoid the use of such expressions in\n   predicate functions.\n\n * Use $watchCollection Over $watch When Appropriate: If you want to observe\n   changes on an entire collection, using $watchCollection is a more efficient\n   choice.\n\n * Restrict Watch Depth: While $watch without any flags watches all levels of an\n   object, using objectEquality or a more specific watch strategy can reduce the\n   depth of the watch and enhance performance.\n\n\nPITFALLS TO AVOID\n\n * Repeated Definition of Watches: Redundant watches on the same expression can\n   lead to needless performance hits. For example, if you call $watch or\n   $watchGroup on a given expression multiple times, ensure they are necessary.\n\n * Uncontrolled $watch Usage: Failing to eliminate $watch instances as relevant\n   scopes are destroyed can lead to memory leaks and degrade performance.\n\n * Heavy Reliance on $watch: Angular offers other, often more efficient,\n   observability mechanisms ($watchCollection, $watchGroup, and $onChanges) that\n   can be used in place of $watch in specific contexts.\n\n * Excessive Use inside ngRepeat and ngInclude: Using $watch within these\n   directives can spawn and sustain an excessive number of watches, contributing\n   to poor performance. Instead, consider precomputing the necessary values or\n   utilizing a custom directive for enhanced control.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: REDUCING WATCH DEPTH\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n// Example with reduced watch depth using objectEquality\n$scope.$watch('largeObject', function(newVal, oldVal) {\n    if (newVal !== oldVal) {\n        console.log('largeObject updated');\n    }\n}, true);\n\n\nIn this example, true configures an object-equality comparison, evaluating\nchanges to the whole object.\n\nThis mitigates the need for deep object comparison, enhancing the watch's\nefficiency.","index":59,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"61.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON PERFORMANCE ISSUES IN ANGULARJS APPLICATIONS?","answer":"While AngularJS provides powerful features, performance issues can arise in\ncomplex applications.\n\n\nKEY CHALLENGES\n\n 1.

Although isolating scopes can lead to a more modular and\nmaintainable codebase, the mechanism itself can impact performance and hinder\nreusability.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE IMPACT OF ISOLATED SCOPES\n\n * Digest Cycle Overhead: Each isolated scope requires its own digest cycle.\n   This can lead to increased memory and CPU usage, especially when dealing with\n   large or dynamically changing datasets.\n\n * Additional Watchers: More memory and computational resources are consumed, as\n   isolated scopes spawn new watchers. It's essential to be mindful of the\n   overall number of watchers in the application, especially with earlier\n   versions of AngularJS.\n\n * Event Propagation: While $broadcast and $emit offer flexibility in scoping\n   events within the hierarchical chain of controllers, they do add an extra\n   layer of event propagation, which can introduce potential bottlenecks in\n   earlier versions.\n\n * Potential for Overload: A multitude of nested and isolated scopes can make\n   the application harder to manage and debug. It's important to evaluate the\n   necessity of each isolated scope, especially in complex, multi-level\n   structures.\n\n\nREUSABILITY AND ISOLATION\n\n * Directive Segregation: Isolated scopes are appropriate when a directive needs\n   to maintain autonomy and encapsulate its functionality. This encapsulation\n   can inadvertently reduce reusability by limiting the directive's ability to\n   access parent scopes.\n\n * Dependence on Context: An isolated scope severs ties with its parent, relying\n   on explicit key-value pairs in the directive declaration for any contextual\n   interaction. This makes it less adaptable, especially when a directive needs\n   access to both its local and parent scopes. Tools like \"transclude\" and a\n   more carefully managed set of scope properties can mitigate this challenge.\n\n * Code Duplication: The lack of direct access to parent scopes and a reduced\n   sharing of state or methods can encourage repetitive code, potentially\n   leading to maintenance difficulties and more substantial codebases.\n\n\nSTRIKING A BALANCE\n\n * Scope Isolation Management: A judicious mix of isolated and inherited scopes,\n   and even enabling shared scopes with scope: true, ensures resources are\n   utilized efficiently while maintaining a well-defined scope hierarchy.\n\n * Modular Approach: Rather than solely relying on isolated scopes, consider\n   employing other mechanisms, such as controllerAs, services, or a flat store\n   like Redux, to foster modularity and data access across components more\n   conveniently.\n\n * Testing and Debugging Focus: A controlled number of isolated scopes aids in\n   easier unit testing and issue resolution, but an overabundance can make it\n   challenging to trace state and behavior.\n\nIn summary, while isolated scopes play an integral role in keeping directives\nself-contained and predictable, failing to balance their use can lead to\nperformance bottlenecks and hamper code reusability. It's a feature best\nembraced selectively, with a keen eye on its interactions with other components.","index":61,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"63.\n\n\nDISCUSS ANGULARJS SECURITY BEST PRACTICES.","answer":"Let's look at the AngularJS security best practices.\n\n\nKEY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS IN ANGULARJS\n\n * Common Vulnerabilities: The most common AngularJS vulnerabilities include\n   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and data\n   vulnerabilities like SQL injection.\n\n * Authentication and Authorization: AngularJS integrates with third-party\n   libraries for secure user authentication and role-based access control.\n\n * Input Validation: Proper input validation against client queries can help\n   prevent misuse.\n\nTHE KEY COMPONENTS\n\n * Data Binding: Two-way data binding between the view and model could\n   potentially expose sensitive data to unsafe contexts.

This will include\nautomatic and manual techniques. Additionally, we will explore some advantages\nof manual bootstrapping.\n\n\nAUTOMATIC VS. MANUAL BOOTSTRAPPING\n\nAutomatic Bootstrapping is the default method. AngularJS uses the ng-app\ndirective to link the app to specific HTML elements. This directive is usually\napplied to the <body> or <div> element.\n\nBy contrast, Manual Bootstrapping gives developers more control. It involves\ncalling the angular.bootstrap() method within the JavaScript code. This manual\napproach is the preferred method in projects using third-party libraries, and\nit's necessary in some TypeScript projects.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: AUTOMATIC VS. MANUAL BOOTSTRAPPING\n\nHere are the two approaches side by side:\n\nAUTOMATIC BOOTSTRAPPING\n\nHTML:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\" ng-app=\"myApp\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Automatic Bootstrap</title>\n    <script src=\"angular.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"app.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Content here -->\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nJavaScript (app.js):\n\nangular.module('myApp', []);\n\n\nIn this case, the ng-app directive is used in the <html> tag to automatically\nbootstrap the AngularJS application associated with the myApp module.\n\nMANUAL BOOTSTRAPPING\n\nHTML:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Manual Bootstrap</title>\n    <script src=\"angular.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"app.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"manualAppRoot\">\n        <!-- Content here -->\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        angular.bootstrap(document.getElementById('manualAppRoot'), ['myApp']);\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nJavaScript (app.js):\n\nangular.module('myApp', []);\n\n\nIn this example, the angular.bootstrap() method is used to manually bootstrap\nthe AngularJS application associated with the myApp module. This method is\ncalled after the document has been fully loaded.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF MANUAL BOOTSTRAPPING\n\n 1. Control of the Bootstrapping Process: With manual bootstrapping, developers\n    can control precisely when the Angular application is initialized. This\n    provides flexibility in complex projects that might necessitate a specific\n    initialization order.\n\n 2. Integration with Third-Party Libraries: Some third-party libraries might\n    require manual bootstrapping to work alongside AngularJS. An example of this\n    is the manual initialization required by AngularJS and jQuery to co-exist.\n\n 3. Unit Testing: Manual bootstrapping is advantageous in unit testing\n    environments. It allows developers to initialize different versions of the\n    application with distinct sets of modules, which can be beneficial for\n    testing.","index":66,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"68.\n\n\nDISCUSS THE USE OF LINKING FUNCTIONS AND THEIR PURPOSE IN CUSTOM DIRECTIVES.","answer":"In AngularJS, Directives enable you to extend HTML functionality, allowing\ncustom web components through elements, attributes, CSS classes, and comments.\n\nLinking Functions provide a way to separate directive-related behaviors into pre\nand post-compile functions.\n\n\nTWO-STEP DIRECTIVE COMPILATION\n\nAngularJS directives go through a two-phase compilation:\n\n 1. Compile Phase: The template of the directive is transformed before a proper\n    scope is created. The compile function is the key feature in this phase.\n 2. Link Phase: The compiled directive is attached to the scope.\n\n\nLINKING FUNCTIONS IN EACH PHASE\n\n 1. Compile Function: Directives execute the compile function before DOM\n    linking. The purpose is to configure the behavior of the directive. It's a\n    global setting and doesn't depend on the linked scopes.\n\n 2.

When working with HTTP API functionalities, you can\nencapsulate communication and use Promises or Observables for data exchange.\n\n\nSTEPS TO CREATE A CUSTOM SERVICE FOR API FUNCTIONALITY\n\n 1. Define the Service\n    \n    * Create a new Angular Service using the service method.\n    * Designate the service as a factory to ensure singleton behavior.\n    \n    angular.module('myApp', [])\n      .factory('apiService', ['$http', function($http) {\n        return {\n          get: function(url) {\n            return $http.get(url);\n          },\n          post: function(url, data) {\n            return $http.post(url, data);\n          }\n        };\n      }]);\n    \n\n 2. Use dependency injection:\n    Inject the $http service, dedicated to HTTP communications, into the custom\n    apiService.\n\n 3. Service Abstraction:\n    \n    * Abstract the type of HTTP request (get/post/delete/put).\n    * Leverage $http methods to correspond with API endpoints.\n\n 4. Prepare for Unit Testing:\n    \n    * Abstracting API calls aids testing through mocked services.\n    * Using promises allows thorough testing, since promise resolutions are\n      controlled.\n\n 5. Bind to a Controller or Directive:\n    \n    * Utilize the service in a controller, keeping the data model separate.\n    * You can also employ controllers or directives to configure $watch and\n      $observe behaviors with promises.\n\n 6.

Implementing bidirectional data-binding with\nservices requires establishing a direct relationship using angular's tools for\ncreating custom observers and observables.\n\n\nSERVICE OBSERVABLES\n\nAn observable is a powerful concept that allows for seamless data\nsynchronization between different parts of your application. Essentially, it's a\nway for one part of your app to subscribe to changes in another part.\n\nThis mechanism is extensively used in JavaScript frameworks like Angular and\nlibraries such as rxjs.\n\nSETUP FOR OBSERVABLES\n\nAn observable service maintains a centralized data source, and components can\nsubscribe to it, automatically receiving updates when the data changes.\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Observable, Subject } from 'rxjs';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class DataService {\n  private dataSubject = new Subject<string>();\n  data$: Observable<string> = this.dataSubject.asObservable();\n\n  updateData(newData: string) {\n    this.dataSubject.next(newData);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nUSING SUBSCRIPTION\n\nAngular components can utilize the subscribe method to establish a connection\nand receive updates whenever the data within the service changes.\n\nHere is the TypeScript code:\n\nimport { Component, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { DataService } from './data.service';\nimport { Subscription } from 'rxjs';\n\n@Component({...})\nexport class DataComponent implements OnDestroy {\n  data: string;\n  dataSubscription: Subscription;\n\n  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {\n    this.dataSubscription = dataService.data$.subscribe(newData => {\n      this.data = newData;\n    });\n  }\n\n  updateDataLocally(newData: string) {\n    this.dataService.updateData(newData);\n    this.data = newData;  // Update locally for immediate feedback\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.dataSubscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, DataComponent automatically updates its data attribute whenever\nthe data inside DataService changes, thanks to the subscription.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS OF USING SERVICES FOR BIDIRECTIONAL DATA BINDING\n\nIn Angular, services are meant to be singletons with a shared state across the\napplication. As such, services are not designed for multiple independent\ninstances. Consequently, using services for two-way binding in multi-component\nscenarios can lead to conflicts and unintended data sharing.

This indicated location is referred\nto as the transclusion anchor.\n\nAngular offers two modes of transclusion:\n\n * Element transclusion: Defined by <ng-transclude></ng-transclude> element in\n   the directive's template, this mode replaces the anchor element with the\n   transcluded content.\n * Attribute-value transclusion: Achieved through ng-transclude=\"true\" attribute\n   within the directive's template, this mode introduces transcluded content\n   into the specific element bearing the attribute.\n\nHere is the AngularJS markup to support both transclusion modes:\n\n * Element Transclusion:\n   Define the transclude section within the directive's template:\n   \n   <div>\n     <h2>Directive's Title</h2>\n     <div ng-transclude></div>\n   </div>\n   \n   \n   Tip: When transcluding an element that has its own ng-controller, remember to\n   use transclude: 'element' in your directive definition.\n\n * Attribute-Value Transclusion:\n   Define specific elements or attributes to host the transcluded content:\n   \n   <div>\n     <h2>Directive's Title</h2>\n     <div ng-transclude=\"true\"></div>\n   </div>\n   \n\n\nPRACTICAL USES OF TRANSCLUSION IN ANGULARJS\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n * Wrapper-Directive Composition: Complex wrappers use transclusion to encompass\n   and standardize the layout of diverse collection patterns.\n * Tabular View Controllers: Tab systems applied in accord with the element\n   transclusion prompt users with interactive tabs.\n * **","index":74,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"76.\n\n\nHOW DOES ANGULARJS WORK WITH RESTFUL APIS?","answer":"AngularJS is designed to integrate seamlessly with RESTful APIs.\n\n\nTWO-WAY BINDING\n\nOne of AngularJS's key features is Two-Way Data Binding. This ensures any\nupdates to the model are instantly reflected in the view, and vice versa. With\nRESTful APIs, this means your frontend and backend will remain in perfect sync.\n\n\nDIRECTIVES AND REST OPERATIONS\n\nThe HTTP methods in a RESTful architecture (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are\nsimilarly mapped to AngularJS directives to interact with the backend:\n\n * $http.get: Retrieves data\n * $http.post: Adds new data\n * $http.put: Updates existing data\n * $http.delete: Removes data\n * $http.head: Retrieves headers\n * $http.jsonp: Supports cross-domain JSONP requests\n\n\nAJAX UNDER THE HOOD\n\nAngularJS leverages AJAX to communicate with RESTful APIs. This is managed by\n$http, a service offering high-level methods like .get(), .post(), etc.\n\nWhen the application invokes an $http method, like .get(), several actions are\ntriggered behind the scenes:\n\n * An HTTP request is formed.\n * The request is dispatched to the server.\n * When the server responds, the promise associated with the request is resolved\n   or rejected.\n\n\nMAPPINGS TO BACKEND RESOURCES\n\nAngularJS typically interacts with backend resources using RESTful service URLs.\nOften, $resource or $http is used in combination with Promise to manage these\ninteractions.\n\n\nUSER-INTERFACE INTERACTIONS\n\nAngularJS ensures slick user interactions. For instance, if a user is editing a\nrecord, subsequent edits to that same record do not immediately reflect on the\nview until the user is done, maintaining data integrity and a better user\nexperience.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: USING $HTTP FOR A GET REQUEST\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n$http({\n    method: 'GET',\n    url: '/api/data'\n}).then(function(response){\n    // Handle the data received\n}, function(error){\n    // Handle any errors\n});\n\n\nThis is how the GET request is structured using $http.","index":75,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"77.\n\n\nWHAT ARE BEST PRACTICES IN DESIGNING ANGULARJS SERVICES THAT INTERACT WITH\nBACKEND APIS?","answer":"When creating services in AngularJS, it's critical to establish a solid\nfoundation for interfacing with backend APIs. This foundation should serve as\nthe \"Single Responsibility\": a characteristic that establishes a clear purpose\nand defined scope for each service.\n\n\nSERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nREQUEST BUILDER\n\nThe Request Builder is in charge of creating and validating the API request.\n\n * Ensure each request remains consistent and conforms to the API's expected\n   format.\n\nAPI CONNECTOR\n\nThe API Connector is responsible for the actual data exchange. It can handle,\n\n * Local caching for optimization.\n * Interception for tasks like logging, transformation, or error management.\n * Connection security layers for token handling or headers modification.\n\nRESPONSE HANDLER\n\nThis module focuses on handling backend responses.\n\n * Centralizes error checking, facilitating a consistent approach to error\n   management.\n * Can normalize data to create format abstractions for the rest of the\n   application.\n\nMESSAGING SYSTEM\n\nThis abstracts the UI from direct service usage.\n\n * Uses blocking (Promises, Observables) or non-blocking patterns (RxJS Subject)\n   for improved stability.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nHere is the AngularJS code example:\n\napp.service('dataService', function($http) {\n\n  // Request Builder\n  this.buildRequest = function(endpoint, method, data) {\n    return {\n      url: `https://api.example.com/${endpoint}`,\n      method: method,\n      data: data\n    };\n  };\n\n  // API Connector\n  this.connectAPI = function(request) {\n    return $http(request).then(response => {\n      // Cache response locally\n      return response.data;\n    });\n  };\n\n  // Response Handler\n  this.handleResponse = function(promise) {\n    return promise.catch(err => {\n      console.error('API Error:', err);\n      return Promise.reject('An error occurred.');\n    });\n  };\n\n  // Messaging System\n  this.getData = function() {\n    return this.handleResponse(this.connectAPI(this.buildRequest('getData', 'GET', null)));\n  };\n});\n\n\n\nSYNCHRONOUS VS. ASYNCHRONOUS DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nAngularJS services must handle data synchronously or asynchronously, based on\nthe:\n\n * Immediate need for data.\n * Data retrieval mode (single data retrievals, like 'GET', vs. batch fetching,\n   like 'POST').\n * The service's role in the application (data-focused or action-focused).\n\nTo implement synchronicity, services should:\n\n * Use promises for one-time data emissions.\n * Utilize observables (or, in AngularJS, $watch or $rootScope.$broadcast) for\n   continuous data flow.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: SYNCHRONOUS DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nHere is the AngularJS code example:\n\napp.service('dataService', function($http, $q) {\n  this.getData = function() {\n    return $http.get('https://api.example.com/data').then(response => response.data);\n  };\n\n  this.$watch('data', () => {\n    console.log('Data updated:', this.data);\n  });\n});\n\n\n\nERROR HANDLING\n\nConsistent and clear error management is pivotal for robust application\nbehaviour.\n\n * For predictable, handled errors, use catch blocks in promises.\n * For unexpected errors, such as responses outside the 2xx HTTP range, use then\n   blocks with both success and error callbacks.\n\nAngularJS enhances error management with features like HTTP Interceptors,\ntargeting all outgoing requests for standardization.\n\n * Even a single HTTP request not conforming to the defined error handling\n   process can lead to inconsistency across the application.\n * Interceptors can ensure a uniform response to errors without the need for\n   scattered .catch() blocks in services across the codebase.\n\nInterceptors also serve as an ideal utility for actions like token refreshing or\nrequest timeout management.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: HTTP INTERCEPTOR\n\nHere is the AngularJS code example:\n\n// HTTP Interceptor for Consistent Error Handling\napp.factory('errorInterceptor', function($q) {\n  return {\n    responseError: function(rejection) {\n      console.error('API Error:', rejection);\n      return $q.reject('An error occurred.');\n    }\n  };\n});\n\n// Register Interceptor\napp.config(function($httpProvider) {\n  $httpProvider.interceptors.push('errorInterceptor');\n});\n\n\n\nDATA CACHING FOR PERFORMANCE\n\nIn many applications, repeat API requests for unchanging data are unnecessary\nand could lead to a data inconsistency or performance degradation.\n\nAngularJS services can manage data caching to optimize data transfer with tools:\n\n * $cacheFactory for manual, in-memory caching.\n * HTTP’s built-in cache for response persistence. It uses caching directives\n   from the server's response headers.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: DATA CACHING\n\nHere is the AngularJS code example:\n\napp.service('dataService', function($http, $cacheFactory) {\n  const dataCache = $cacheFactory('dataCache');\n\n  this.getData = function(useCache = true) {\n    const config = {};\n    if (useCache) {\n      config.cache = dataCache;\n    }\n    return $http.get('https://api.example.com/data', config).then(response => response.data);\n  };\n});\n","index":76,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"78.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE RESTFUL RESOURCE RELATIONS IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"AngularJS allows for seamless interaction with RESTful services through the\n\"ngResource\" module, which simplifies resource management.\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS\n\n * $resource: Represents a RESTful resource on the client side, abstracting HTTP\n   methods behind a service-like interface.\n * Actions: Orchestrates HTTP methods for a resource.\n * $resource instance: Leverages two-way data binding, keeping the view and\n   model in sync.\n\n\nCODE STRUCTURE\n\nSERVICE DEFINITION\n\nDefine a service to initialize and interact with the RESTful resource.\n\nangular.module('myApp', ['ngResource']).\n    factory('Article', function($resource) {\n        return $resource('/api/articles/:articleId', {articleId: '@id'});\n    });\n\n\nCONTROLLER UTILIZATION\n\nInject the service into a controller to expose its methods to the view.\n\nangular.module('myApp').\n    controller('ArticleCtrl', function($scope, Article) {\n        $scope.articleList = Article.query();\n        $scope.selectedArticle = null;\n\n        $scope.viewArticle = function(articleId) {\n            $scope.selectedArticle = Article.get({articleId: articleId});\n        };\n\n        $scope.createArticle = function(articleData) {\n            Article.save(articleData, function(response) {\n                $scope.articleList.push(response);\n            });\n        };\n\n        // Other methods for updating and deleting articles\n    });\n\n\n\nMETHOD DEFINITIONS\n\n * query(): Executes a GET request to retrieve a collection of resources.\n * get(params): Retrieves a single resource with the provided parameters.\n * save(): Sends a POST request to create a new resource or update an existing\n   one.\n * remove(): Issues a DELETE request to remove a specific resource.\n\n\nKEY POINTS TO REMEMBER\n\n * mark changes about parameter convention in method get\n * note changes in example code to match the new $resource style","index":77,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"79.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT INTERNATIONALIZATION IN ANGULARJS?","answer":"Let me advise you on implementing internationalization (i18n) in AngularJS using\nangular-translate.

LOGGING\n\n * Use $log service instead of console.log to maintain consistency, especially\n   in a production environment.\n * Inject $log into a controller or service and call methods like $log.debug(),\n   $log.info(), $log.error(), etc.\n\nCode Example:\n\napp.controller('myController', function($log) {\n    $log.debug(\"This is a debug message.\");\n});\n\n\n\n4. USING DEBUG INFO\n\n * In AngularJS 1.3 and above, the digest cycle ($digest) now initializes from\n   the root scope. To trace which scopes trigger the digest cycle, enable\n   $rootScopeProvider's debugInfoEnabled property.\n   \n   app.config(function($rootScopeProvider) {\n       $rootScopeProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false); // Set to `true` for debugging\n   });\n   \n\n\n5. DEBUGGING DIRECTIVES\n\n * ngModel: Utilize $formatters and $parsers to see data transformations.\n * $watch: Set a breakpoint to observe when changes occur.\n * $on: Useful for tracing and understanding custom events dispatched throughout\n   the application.\n\nCode Example:\n\napp.directive('myDirective', function() {\n    return {\n        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n            attrs.$observe('attribute', function(value) {\n                console.log('Attribute changed to', value);\n            });\n            element.on('click', function() {\n                scope.$emit('directiveClicked', { message: 'Directive clicked!' });\n            });\n            scope.$watch('expression', function(newValue, oldValue) {\n                console.log('Expression changed from', oldValue, 'to', newValue);\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n\n\n\n6. ANGULARJS PROFILER\n\nIncorporate AngularJS's built-in Profiler to get insights on various aspects of\nyour application.\n\nCode Example:\n\n 1. Load the angular.js library with the parameter ng:debug.\n    \n    <script src=\"angular.js?ng:debug\"></script>\n    \n\n 2. Attach the Profiler with the command:\n    \n    angular.reloadWithDebugInfo();\n    \n\n 3. After reloading your application, inspect $rootScope in the Console tab of\n    Chrome DevTools.\n\n 4. Expand it to see detailed information related to watchers and other\n    attributes.","index":83,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"85.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON DEBUGGING TECHNIQUES IN AN ANGULARJS CONTEXT?","answer":"Debugging in AngularJS often involves understanding Angular's two-way data\nbinding, module handling, scope inheritance, and nested views.\n\n\nDOM TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES\n\nUSE DIRECTIVES AND ELEMENT INSPECTOR\n\nIn more complex Angular applications, identifying specific elements for styling,\nevent binding, or data rendering can be challenging. Using custom directives or\nspecialized Angular directives like ng-model, ng-click, or ng-show serve as\nvaluable debugging & styling tools.\n\nMASTER THE BATARANG EXTENSION\n\nBatarang, a Chrome extension, surfaces Angular-specific data in the Developer\nConsole, enabling real-time tracking of application performance. It's\nparticularly effective for visualizing two-way data binding and improving memory\nmanagement.\n\nLOOK FOR FUNDAMENTAL ANGULAR-SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES\n\nThe presence of Angular-specific attributes in the DOM (e.g., ng-app,\nng-controller) serves as a quick guide to Angular's grasp over HTML elements and\ntheir attached functionalities. Identifying these markers assists in pinpointing\npotential issues.\n\nDECODE THE DOUBLE CURLY BRACES\n\nAngular leverages double curly braces, such as {{ expression }}, to dynamically\noutput data to the view. By observing the expressions that these braces\nevaluate, developers can ensure correct data binding and effective variable\ndisplay and manipulation.\n\n\nDATA BINDING & SCOPE DEBUGGING\n\nLEVERAGE THE POWER OF {{ }} EXPRESSIONS\n\nIntermediate expressions within curly braces are a fantastic option for\nimmediate expression evaluation. This feature is well-paired with an accurate\nconsole.log to verify expected values, data structures, and logical conditions.\n\nVERIFY DATA THROUGH SERVICE INTERACTION\n\nAt its core, Angular propagates data through services and controllers. By\ndesigning tailored services to interact with remote APIs or form extensive\nin-memory data stores, the application's functionality can be rigorously\ninspected and validated.\n\nDIVE INTO SCOPE\n\nUnderstanding scope inheritance, such as establishing ng-controller hierarchies\nor segregating scopes through directives like ng-isolate-scope, is pivotal in\nunderstanding where specific data-origin or data-flow issues emerge.

Useful for logging\n      and data validation.\n    * Example: When the user attempts to leave a form without saving changes, a\n      confirmation prompt can be triggered.\n\n 2. $ROUTECHANGESUCCESS\n    \n    * Resolve Dependencies: Marks the successful navigation completion\n      post-loading of the route's template and associated dependencies.\n\n 3. $ROUTECHANGEERROR\n    \n    * Error Handling: Triggered if problems occur during route resolution.\n      Useful for handling failed data retrieval or authentication errors.\n\n 4. $LOCATIONCHANGESTART\n    \n    * Location Change: Useful when the app monitors URL changes. This event can\n      be employed for debugging or to ensure certain parts of the app are\n      accessed based on a known URL pattern.\n\n 5. $LOCATIONCHANGESUCCESS\n    \n    * Location Change Success: Indicates a successful URL change.\n\n 6. $DESTROY\n    \n    * Cleanup: Non-exclusive to routing, this event allows for resource cleanup\n      before the route or its associated elements are destroyed. This is\n      especially valuable for tasks such as unsubscribing from observables.\n\n\nANGULARJS CORE EVENTS AND THEIR ROLE IN ROUTING\n\nThe $routeChangeStart, $routeChangeSuccess, and $routeChangeError events, used\nprimarily for route navigation, are features tailored to the ngRoute module's\nlegacy routing engine.\n\nDevice Purpose $location Provides low-level API for URL manipulation, including\nhash path and search segment retrieval. $route Manages routing by monitoring URL\nchanges and executing controllers or templates registered to defined routes.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a simplified example that demonstrates the interplay.\nHere is the code:\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ROUTE LIFE CYCLE EVENTS AND ANGULARJS CORE\nEVENTS\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n// Define a module with the 'ngRoute' dependency\nvar app = angular.module('routeExample', ['ngRoute']);\n\n// Configure the routes and controllers\napp.config(function ($routeProvider) {\n    $routeProvider\n        .when('/dashboard', {\n            controller: 'DashboardController',\n            templateUrl: 'dashboard.html'\n        })\n        .when('/settings', {\n            controller: 'SettingsController',\n            templateUrl: 'settings.html'\n        });\n});\n\n// Controllers\napp.controller('DashboardController', function () { /* Optional controller logic here */ });\napp.controller('SettingsController', function () { /* Optional controller logic here */ });\n\n// Implement event monitoring\napp.run(function ($rootScope, $location, $route) {\n    $rootScope.$on('$locationChangeStart', function(event, newValue, oldValue) {\n        // Perform actions, e.g., based on URL changes\n    });\n\n    $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeStart', function (event, next, current) {\n        // Perform pre-route loading tasks, like data validation or logging.\n        var answer = confirm(\"Are you sure you want to navigate away?\");\n        if (!answer) {\n            event.preventDefault();\n        }\n    });\n\n    $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', function () {\n        // Post-route logic\n    });\n});\n\n\nIn this example, when the user tries to leave the 'dashboard' or 'settings'\nview, a confirmation prompt appears for navigational consent. If the user\nconfirms, the route change completes. If not, the event is canceled, and the\nview remains unchanged. This is a simplified implementation of a guard\nmechanism, common in routing systems.","index":88,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"90.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE USE OF REQUIRE IN ANGULARJS DIRECTIVES.","answer":"In AngularJS, the require property in directives establishes a relationship\nbetween directives. It allows directives to communicate, notably when one\ndirective needs another directive's controller.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF USING REQUIRE\n\n * Encapsulation: The feature ensures that the directive bound to the required\n   controller doesn't interact with the directive exposing the controller in\n   unpredictable ways.\n * Reusability: By creating a directed parent-child relationship, the directives\n   become more modular, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.\n * Scope Management: With scope inheritance in mind, require aids in\n   establishing the control flow and data management for the associated DOM\n   elements.\n\n\nTYPES OF CONTROLLERS\n\nWhen using require, you can specify different types of controllers targeted for\ncommunication:\n\n * No Prefix: The directive requires a controller defined on its own DOM\n   element. If that controller is not found, the $compile will throw an error.\n * '?' Prefix: The directive does not throw an error if the target controller\n   isn't found. Using the '?' prefix makes the association optional.\n * '^' Prefix: The directive searches for the controller on its parents. The\n   number of ^ signs determines how far up the DOM hierarchy the directive\n   should look.\n * '=' Prefix: The directive searches for the required controller on its own\n   element or its parents. The search is limited to the level defined by the\n   prefix count.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n * Name Synchronization: Ensure the controller and the required directive have a\n   consistent naming convention for seamless matching.\n * Verbose Error Messages: Include detailed error messages to aid in quicker\n   debugging, especially when the required controller isn't found.\n * Selective Use: Utilize require only when a directive genuinely relies on\n   another directive's controller.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: CONTROLLING BUTTON VISIBILITY\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\n 1.

Directives are the ideal place to handle such\nDOM interactions as they offer a more condensed, maintainable, and clear\napproach.\n\n\nDIRECT VS $ELEMENT AND $DOCUMENT\n\nAngularJS provides options for DOM manipulation:\n\n * jQLite: A subset of jQuery that comes bundled with Angular. It wraps the\n   native document.querySelectorAll() function.\n * jqLite Element: The raw DOM element, often obtained using the element\n   parameter in directives' link functions. This approach simplifies the\n   handling of elements when jQLite or full jQuery is unavailable.\n\nELEMENT AND ATTRS\n\nThe element and attributes objects are provided to the directive's linking\nfunction. These are arguments passed to the directive's link function, giving\nthe directive access to the treated (jQLite) element the directive is attached\nto.\n\n.directive('myDirective', function(){\n  return {\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs){\n      element.text('Hello, World!');\n      element.addClass('highlighted');\n      console.log(attrs.myAttribute);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\nHere, element refers to the directive's DOM container, while attrs refers to any\nHTML-tag attributes the directive might have. They both are more like read-only\nviews of the original DOM.\n\n$DOCUMENT\n\nAn getter function, $document, returns the document instance wrapped by jqLite.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE DIRECT MANIPULATION\n\nAuthoritative resources, such as \"AngularJS: Up & Running\" (O'Reilly), advise\nthat whereas ng-model provides a framework-guided way to handle user input,\nthere may still be instances where it's deemed appropriate to interact directly\nwith the DOM. Such selective instances might include dealing with third-party\ncode or libraries that manipulate the DOM.\n\nIn these cases:\n\n * First, exhaust all Angular options.\n * Implement direct manipulation where there's no viable Angular alternative and\n   where the value-add speaks for itself.\n * Always remark on the practice in the code for transparency and future\n   maintenance.\n\nRemember, striking a balance between adherence to best practices and practical\napplication is key.","index":92,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"94.\n\n\nWHAT ARE COMPILE AND PRE/POST LINKING FUNCTIONS?","answer":"During directive definition in AngularJS, you have direct access to four compile\nand linking functions: preCompile, postCompile, preLink, and postLink.\n\n\nKEY FUNCTIONS IN DIRECTIVE DEFINITION\n\n * compile: Invocation - on directive element first.

Several tools and best practices can help with this.\n\n\nCORE CONCEPTS\n\n 1. UI Router: This tool extends AngularJS' routing capabilities, introducing\n    hierarchical states.\n\n 2. State Definitions: Represented by $stateProvider.state(), these encapsulate\n    state logic and templates, enhancing modularity.\n\n 3. Controllers and Views: Each state is connected to a view and an associated\n    controller. The view's content updates according to the controller's\n    instructions.\n\n 4. Nested States and Views: UI Router supports nesting states and views,\n    adhering to the principles of components and composability.\n\n 5. State Lifecycle Hooks: States can provide specific callbacks, like onEnter\n    (when a state is about to be activated) and onExit (when it's about to be\n    deactivated).\n\n 6. State Parameters: States can declare parameters, allowing for dynamic\n    behaviors based on user input.\n\n 7. Data Resolvers and Dependencies: Data can be pre-retrieved before a state is\n    activated, ensuring a smoother user experience.\n\n 8. Unified State Configuration: UI Router moves away from route-centric\n    configurations, allowing more comprehensive state setups.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\n 1. Single Responsibility: A state should handle a distinct piece of application\n    logic, simplifying state management and debugging.\n\n 2. Modularity and Hierarchies: Use child states to build a hierarchical UI and\n    logically group related states.\n\n 3. Abstract States: When a state is not meant to be navigated to directly, mark\n    it as abstract.\n\n 4. Resolve Data: Leverage the $resolve property to preload data for a state,\n    enhancing performance.\n\n 5. State Inheritance and Defaults: UI Router supports state inheritance,\n    perfect for sharing common configurations across several states.\n\n 6. URL Routing Flexibility: While states are traditionally linked to URLs, UI\n    Router provides flexibility. You can choose to have URLs point directly to\n    individual states or use them as a base for child states.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: STATE DEFINITION WITH RESOLVE\n\nHere is the AngularJS code:\n\nangular.module('myApp').config(['$stateProvider', function($stateProvider) {\n  $stateProvider\n    .state('user', {\n      url: '/user/:id',\n      templateUrl: 'user.html',\n      controller: 'UserController',\n      resolve: {\n        user: ['UserService', '$stateParams', function(UserService, $stateParams) {\n          return UserService.getUser($stateParams.id);\n        }]\n      }\n    });\n}]);\n","index":94,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"96.\n\n\nCOMPARE $ROUTE VERSUS $STATEPROVIDER.","answer":"Let's look at their features and architectures, as each is tailored for specific\nneeds.\n\n\nKEY DISTINCTIONS\n\n 1. URL Handling:\n    \n    * $route: Designed for Single View Applications (SVAs). It's paramount for\n      handling URLs in these applications. This mechanism also ensures built-in\n      browser navigation compatibility.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: Primarily intended for handling nested views in Multiple\n      View Applications (MVAs). While it manages URLs, its main focus is state\n      management within the application.\n\n 2. Inheritance and Nesting:\n    \n    * $route: Structuring views in a hierarchical manner can be either\n      challenging or limited.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: Tailor-made for multi-level view structures. It provides a\n      natural way to nest states under parent states, simplifying view\n      hierarchies.\n\n 3. URL Route Configuration:\n    \n    * $route: Uses a straightforward approach of defining a URL route and\n      associating a template for the route. It's ideal for simpler,\n      non-hierarchical applications.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: Offers the flexibility of defining states rather than\n      routes, using attributes like ui-view to manage views. This adaptability\n      is especially useful in complex, multi-level applications.\n\n 4. Controller Execution:\n    \n    * $route: Adheres to a straightforward, \"one controller per view\" model.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: Controllers are set to states, which provides finer\n      control and can lead to more optimized controller management.\n\n 5. Usage of Services and Factories:\n    \n    * $route: Doesn't impose any specific handling of services or factories in\n      the routing process.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: With the .resolve() attribute, it allows for dependencies\n      to be resolved before transitioning to a state, providing data integrity.\n\n 6. Freshness of Views:\n    \n    * $route: Reloads a view and its associated controller when its route is\n      matched, ensuring updated data.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: Offers varied approaches like reloadOnSearch to control\n      when a view should be reloaded, providing more flexibility in view\n      management.\n\n 7. Backwards Compatibility:\n    \n    * $route: A core AngularJS feature up to version 1.6. It has since been\n      replaced by $routeProvider in AngularJS 1.6+ and Angular 2+.\n    \n    * $stateProvider: Typically used in UI-Router, an AngularJS third-party\n      extension, chosen for its advanced state management capabilities.","index":95,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"97.\n\n\nHOW DOES DATA PERSISTENCE WORK IN ANGULARJS APPLICATIONS?","answer":"Data Persistence ensures that application data remains consistent across\ndifferent sessions and deployments. AngularJS provides tools for front-end data\nhandling, but for true end-to-end persistence, it relies on a back-end\ntechnology.\n\n\nANGULAR JS: FRONT-END DATA HANDLING\n\nAngularJS uses both its own constructs and vernacular JavaScript tools to handle\ndata on the front-end. Features like built-in services, scope management, and\ntwo-way data binding streamline data manipulation.\n\n\nANGULAR AND SERVER INTERACTIONS\n\nAngular is designed to communicate with a server through traditional HTTP/REST\nAPIs, which form the backbone of data synchronization in Angular applications.\n\nThe stack typically works as a series starting from the database and APIs in the\nback-end to the front-end of the application via HTTP requests where Angular\nserves as the coordinator.\n\nFor instance, the technologies involved in a stack can be:\n\n * For the back-end: Node.js, Express, and MongoDB\n * For the front-end: Angular, HTML/CSS, and TypeScript (transpiles to\n   JavaScript)\n\nThis is why Angular can't be seen as a complete standalone solution, and needs a\nback-end (server, database, etc.) to effectively provide data persistence.\n\n\nSEPARATION OF FRONT-END AND BACK-END\n\nModern web development domains employ a principle known as the \"Separation of\nConcerns\" where distinct roles are maintained between the front-end (serving as\nthe user interface) and the back-end (serving as the data processing engine).\n\nAngular successfully separates these concerns, letting developers focus on\nbuilding a robust and efficient user interface while leaving background data\ntasks to the supporting back-end technologies.\n\n\nREAL-TIME WEB APPLICATIONS\n\nWith the advent of technologies like Websockets and platform as a service (PaaS)\nsystems like Firebase, the separation between front-end and back-end has become\nless rigid. Firebase, for example, is a database, as well as an API service,\nthat keeps real-time data in sync across all connected clients. Because of this,\nit may sometimes act as a backend for smaller or real-time specific\napplications, eliminating the need to implement a separate backend.\n\nIt provides features like user authentication, live database updates, serverless\nfunctionality, and a lot more, truly blurring the lines between back-end and\nfront-end technologies.\n\n\nCODE EXAMPLE: ANGULAR SERVICES AND BACKEND CONNECTIVITY\n\nHere is the Angular Service:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class DataService {\n\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\n\n  getAppData() {\n    return this.http.get('https://your-api-url/data');\n  }\n\n  updateData(newData: any) {\n    return this.http.post('https://your-api-url/update', newData);\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe Service's functions are tailored to interface with the back-end. For\nexample, getAppData() uses an HTTP GET request to fetch data, and updateData()\nemploys an HTTP POST request to update it.","index":96,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"98.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES FOR SAVING APPLICATION STATE ACROSS PAGE RELOADS?","answer":"AngularJS offers several strategies to persist an application's state even after\na page reload.\n\n\nSTATE-PERSISTENCE STRATEGIES\n\n * localStorage: Convenient storage for small amounts of data. Useful with\n   AngularJS's $rootScope.\n\n * $rootScope & Service Communication: Use $rootScope to share data across\n   controllers. Services can further ensure persistence.\n\n * Cache on Route Change: Use resolve to cache data until a route changes.\n\n * onChange Event: Utilize onbeforeunload to prompt users before leaving a page\n   with unsaved changes.\n\nEXAMPLE: LOCAL STORAGE SET-UP\n\nHere is the Code:\n\n// App Module\nvar app = angular.module('app', []);\n\n// Service to manage local storage\napp.service('localStorageService', function () {\n  var storageKey = 'appState'; // Key for accessing local storage\n\n  // Save app state to local storage\n  this.saveState = function (state) {\n    localStorage.setItem(storageKey, JSON.stringify(state));\n  };\n\n  // Get app state from local storage\n  this.getState = function () {\n    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(storageKey));\n  };\n});\n\n// Controller to Manage State\napp.controller('stateController', function ($scope, localStorageService) {\n  // Initialize with previous state (if any)\n  var savedState = localStorageService.getState();\n  $scope.state = savedState || {};\n\n  // Watch for changes in state and persist to local storage\n  $scope.$watch('state', function (newValue, oldValue) {\n    if (newValue !== oldValue) {\n      localStorageService.saveState(newValue);\n    }\n  }, true);\n});\n","index":97,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"},{"text":"99.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE DOS AND DON'TS REGARDING ANGULARJS BEST PRACTICES?","answer":"Here are the do's and dont's to keep in mind when employing AngularJS best\npractices.\n\n\nDOS\n\nFILE ORGANIZATION\n\n * Separate by Feature: Divide the app by features, not the architecture type,\n   such as controllers and templates.\n * Group by Type: Keep similar files together, like templates in a templates\n   folder.\n\nMODULES\n\n * Create Small, Focused Modules: Encapsulate related functions, directives, and\n   services. Aim for high reusability.\n * Define Dependencies with Strings: Make sure to use this format ['dep1',\n   'dep2', function(dep1, dep2) { ... }] to avoid minification issues.\n\nDIRECTIVES\n\n * Use Emscripten Directives: Prioritize this directive type to boost\n   performance in handling DOM manipulations.\n\nSCOPE\n\n * Understand Scope Inheritance: Master the scope hierarchy to avoid common\n   pitfalls.\n\nSERVICES\n\n * Use Singletons: Services are globally accessible singletons, reducing\n   redundancy.\n\n\nDON'TS\n\nFILE ORGANIZATION\n\n * Group by Type: Avoid organizing files based on types like controllers or\n   services.\n\nMODULES\n\n * Reuse Names: Use unique module names to avoid conflicts, especially when\n   leveraging third-party components.\n\nDIRECTIVES\n\n * Excess DOM Interaction: Mind the balance between ease of use and overreliance\n   on communicating with the DOM.

OVERUSE OF $ROOTSCOPE\n\nIt's best to minimize the use of $rootScope. Instead, use Services or Component\noutput to facilitate inter-controller communication.\n\nAnti-Pattern Example:\n\napp.controller('Controller1', function($scope, $rootScope) {\n  $scope.data = 123;\n  $rootScope.globalData = $scope.data;  // Assigning to $rootScope directly, impacting memory\n});\n\napp.controller('Controller2', function($scope, $rootScope) {\n  $scope.retrievedData = $rootScope.globalData;  // Accessing data indirectly, causing potential issues\n});\n\n\nBest Practice:\n\napp.controller('Controller1', function($scope, dataService) {\n  $scope.data = 123;\n  dataService.setGlobalData($scope.data);  // Using a service to handle data\n});\n\napp.controller('Controller2', function($scope, dataService) {\n  $scope.retrievedData = dataService.getGlobalData();  // Using the service for data interaction\n});\n\n\n2. GLOBAL STATE MANAGEMENT WITH $ROOTSCOPE\n\nMaintaining global state with $rootScope can lead to ambiguities and cause\nunpredictable behavior. It's preferable to use a state management library, such\nas RxJS or NgRx, alongside modern Angular versions.\n\n3. ACCIDENTAL COMPLEX DOM ELEMENTS SELECTION\n\nEven though jQuery might be in the project, it's better not to mix it with\nAngularJS for DOM manipulation. Leveraging Angular's built-in directives and\nbestowing such responsibilities on directives is more consistent and imbuued\nwith clarity.\n\nAnti-Pattern Example:\n\napp.directive('myDirective', function() {\n  return {\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n      $('.some-class').style('display', 'block');  // Making use of jQuery in a directive.\n    }\n  };\n});\n\n\nBest Practice:\n\napp.directive('myDirective', function() {\n  return {\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n      element.find('.some-class').css('display', 'block');  // Using Angular's jqLite for DOM manipulation within directives\n    }\n  };\n});\n\n\n5. FORGOING NESTED SCOPES\n\nWhile global scopes might circumvent nested scopes, there may be occasions where\nleveraging child controllers with services and components becomes more fitting\nespecially when the need for a local scope arises or when modules are structured\nas feature modules or application-wide modules.\n\n6. HAPHAZARD DEPENDENCY INJECTION\n\nAngularJS employs Implicit and Explicit Dependency Injection.\n\nThe default is Implicit, but for the sake of clarity and streamlining the\nupgrade to future Angular, it is suggested to shift to Explicit mode.\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES IN ANGULARJS\n\nHere are some recommended best practices for AngularJS development:\n\nCODE ORGANIZATION\n\n * Arrange the code based on functionality rather than role, i.e., Feature\n   Modules.\n * Do not overburden controllers with excessive responsibilities. Let them focus\n   on the view logic.\n * Services are best-suited for centralized business logic, abstracting data\n   interactions and forking out global app functionalities.\n\nDATA HANDLING\n\n * Dodge using complex nested watches or unpragmatic, observable flag variables\n   to handle user interactions.\n * Consider reframing the data structure to avoid the nuisance of cascading\n   changes.\n\nDOM INTERACTIONS\n\n * Make the best of Angular directives for DOM manipulation, promoting a modular\n   template structure.","index":99,"topic":" AngularJS ","category":"Web & Mobile Dev Fullstack Dev"}]
