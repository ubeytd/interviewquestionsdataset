For instance:\n   \n   text = \"Hello\"\n   lowercase_text = text.lower()\n   # Returns a new string in lower-case without altering 'text'.\n   \n\n * Advantages:\n   \n   * Thread-Safety: Immutable strings are inherently thread-safe, making them\n     easier to use in concurrent environments.\n\n * Disadvantages:\n   \n   * Memory Overhead: Generating a new string for every modification can lead to\n     a higher memory footprint, especially with large strings.\n   * Efficiency Concerns: Creating a new string object can be more\n     resource-intensive than modifying an existing one in-place.\n\n\nMUTABLE STRINGS\n\n * Behavior: Mutable strings allow direct changes to their content without\n   creating a new string.\n\n * Example: In Java, while the String class is immutable, the StringBuilder and\n   StringBuffer classes provide mutable string implementations. Similarly, in\n   C++, std::string objects are mutable and can be modified directly using\n   functions like string.replace() or by accessing individual characters.\n\n * Advantages:\n   \n   * Memory Efficiency: In-place modifications can save on memory by avoiding\n     the creation of new string objects.\n   * Performance: Direct access and modification of string characters can be\n     faster than creating new strings.\n\n * Disadvantages:\n   \n   * Thread-Safety: Mutable strings can pose synchronization challenges in\n     parallel or multi-threaded applications, necessitating extra precautions\n     for proper management.","index":3,"topic":" Strings ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"},{"text":"5.\n\n\nHOW DO DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IMPLEMENT AND MANIPULATE STRINGS?","answer":"Let's look at the key ways in which different programming languages handle\nstrings, ranging from mutable vs. immutable semantics to character encoding and\nmore.\n\n\nPIONEERING LANGUAGES\n\nThese languages serve as the roots of many modern programming paradigms:\n\nFORTRAN (1956)\n\n * Character Encodings: Initially designed for punch cards, its support was\n   later extended to more modern encodings.\n\nC (1972)\n\n * Data Structure: Strings are represented as arrays of characters terminated by\n   a null character ('\\0'), which makes them mutable.\n * Character Encoding: Initially relied on ASCII, later supporting other\n   encodings based on environment.\n\nADA (1977)\n\n * Substrings: Provides substrings using the Ada.Strings.Fixed package.\n\n\nTEXTBOOK LANGUAGES\n\nThese widely-taught languages have left an indelible mark on programming\neducation:\n\nPASCAL (1970)\n\n * Data Structures: Uses arrays or sequence data types to store strings.\n * Character Case: Unlike many modern languages, Pascal retains a distinct\n   difference between upper and lower case characters.\n\nC++ (1985)\n\n * Standard Library: Introduced the std::string class, which offers a more\n   comprehensive and safer string manipulation compared to C-style strings.\n\nSWIFT (2014)\n\n * Character Encodings: Strings are encoded in UTF-8 by default.\n\nGO (2009)\n\n * Immutable Strings: Once defined, strings are immutable and cannot be changed.\n\n\nMODERN DYNAMIC LANGUAGES\n\nThese languages have seen widespread adoption in web and app development:\n\nJAVASCRIPT (1995)\n\n * Data Type: Strings are treated as a separate atomic data type.\n * High-Level Methods: The String object provides numerous utility methods for\n   string manipulation.\n\nPYTHON (1991)\n\n * Data Type: Strings are represented as immutable arrays of Unicode code\n   points.\n * Encoding Support: Python has excellent support for different character\n   encodings, including built-in mechanisms to understand and manipulate\n   non-ASCII strings.\n\nRUBY (1995)\n\n * Character Encodings: String literals in source code are considered UTF-8 by\n   default.\n * String Mutability: Offers both mutable and immutable strings.

Efficient Concatenation: Concatenating two ropes typically involves creating\n    a new node pointing to the original ropes, rather than copying entire\n    strings.\n\n 2. Lazy Evaluation: Ropes execute operations only when necessary, deferring\n    specific computations. For instance, during concatenation, the actual\n    underlying substrings remain unchanged until accessed, optimizing specific\n    tasks' performance.\n\n 3. Memory Efficiency: Instead of storing the whole string contiguously, ropes\n    use nodes holding parts of the string, making them suitable for representing\n    larger strings without needing contiguous memory spaces.\n\n 4. Incremental Length Calculation: Ropes maintain the length of each node,\n    alleviating the need for full traversal during operations like indexing or\n    substring creation.\n\n 5. Balance and Performance Guarantees: Even in worst-case scenarios, operations\n    such as indexing or concatenation in Ropes are bounded by O(log⁡n)O(\\log\n    n)O(logn) time complexity, ensuring predictable and enhanced performance\n    compared to traditional strings.\n\n 6.

Memory Footprint: While efficient for larger strings, Ropes might be less\n    memory-efficient when representing very small strings or when the structure\n    becomes highly fragmented. This inefficiency arises from metadata storage,\n    such as node weights and balance factors.\n\n 3. Cache Performance: While traditional strings benefit from cache coherence\n    due to contiguous memory, Ropes introduce additional pointer dereferences,\n    possibly leading to increased cache misses.\n\n 4. Traversal Overhead: Elementary operations, such as character retrieval,\n    entail tree traversals, making them more computationally intensive compared\n    to their counterparts in regular strings.\n\n 5.

Start reading the input string character by character.\n 2. If the character is found in the list of delimiters, mark the end of the\n    current token.\n 3. If the character is not a delimiter, append it to the current token.\n 4. Return the list of tokens after reaching the end of the input string.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nConsider the following input and delimiter scenarios:\n\n * Input String: \"apple,banana,orange\"\n   \n   * Delimiter: ,\n   * Tokenized Output: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n\n * Input String: \"apple and banana or orange\"\n   \n   * Delimiter: and\n   * Tokenized Output: [\"apple \", \" banana or orange\"]\n\n * Input String: \"apple<=>banana<=>orange\"\n   \n   * Delimiter: <=>\n   * Tokenized Output: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n\n * Input String: \"apple$%^^banana@$%^orange\"\n   \n   * Delimiter: $%^\n   * Tokenized Output: [\"apple\", \"^^banana\", \"@\", \"orange\"]\n\nCOMPLEXITY ANALYSIS\n\n * Time Complexity: O(n⋅m) O(n \\cdot m) O(n⋅m),\n   where n n n is the size of the input string and m m m is the average length\n   of the delimiters.\n\n * Space Complexity: O(1) O(1) O(1) for the tokenization process, while the\n   space required for the output list of tokens is O(n) O(n) O(n), where n n n\n   is the number of tokens.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\ndef tokenize_string(input_string, delimiters):\n    tokens = []\n    current_token = ''\n    delimiter_length = 0\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if delimiter_length == 0 and input_string.startswith(delimiters, len(current_token)):\n            delimiter_length = len(delimiters)\n            if current_token:\n                tokens.append(current_token)\n            current_token = ''\n            continue\n\n        if delimiter_length > 0:\n            delimiter_length -= 1\n            continue\n\n        current_token += char\n\n    if current_token:\n        tokens.append(current_token)\n\n    return tokens\n\n# Example\ninput_string = \"apple and banana or orange\"\ndelimiters = 'and'\nprint(tokenize_string(input_string, delimiters))\n# Output: ['apple ', ' banana or orange']\n","index":49,"topic":" Strings ","category":"Data Structures & Algorithms Data Structures"}]
